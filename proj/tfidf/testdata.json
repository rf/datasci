["Creating a library of functional functs to mutate arbitrary global variables"," Update: If I have a few functions that I want to mutate a global variable that is passed as a function argument, some can do this by passing just the symbol of the global (as in the case of pushing something onto part of a list), but other functions will require that the symbol be quoted when it is passed so I can access the symbol-value and mutate the outside variable, required for using setq in a function. This question is basically about creating a consistent interface for a user of these functions without confusing them that sometimes you pass the symbol, othertimes you pass the quoted symbol    Example way to streamline the interface for a bunch of functions, by using a helper that has the same usage reqardless of how the mutating function works:     Here are 2 basic examples of my technique:    (defun push-something (global something)   (push something global)   global) ;; not necessary to return it here since the            ;; preceding line already does, but doing so            ;; for consistency with other functions and clarity  (defun push-cdr (global something)   (push something (cdr global))   global) ;; must return it if I am going to set the            ;; dynamic var to the result of this function,            ;; because the preceding line doesn't return the            ;; entire new result of the variable  ;;;  dirty  function for mutating global variable using  clean  functions above:  (defun set-global (fn global &amp;rest values)   (setf (symbol-value global) (apply fn (copy-list (eval global)) values)))     In this last one, I must eval the global since it is quoted for use with symbol-value and then I copy-list so that global isn't directly mutated accidentally by whatever fn I choose (as would be the case with push-cdr which might be non-trivial in more complicated functions).    Output:    CL-USER  (defparameter *g2* nil) *G2* CL-USER  (set-global #'push-something '*g2* 5) (5) CL-USER  *g2* (5) CL-USER  (set-global #'push-cdr '*g2* 99) (5 99) CL-USER  *g2* (5 99)     ...and the same functions could be used with *g1* or *g3* etc all through the access function set-global.

I think my understanding of the    operator is off. In this scenario is this the stream extraction, bitwise, or technically both?     My understanding of the narrative of what's happening is: As long as count is less than numEmploy AND empData[][] is receiving a value from payroll.dat, insert the first available chunk of data in payroll.dat into empData[0][0], insert the second chunk (the chunk to the right of the first chunk) into empData[0][1].

Here is my starting code:    TouchCollection touchPositions; List Vector2  touchReleases = new List Vector2 ();     Then this is my update code:    protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime) {               // Other update logic here      touchReleases.Clear();     foreach (TouchLocation tl in touchPositions) {         if (tl.State == TouchLocationState.Released) { touchReleases.Add(tl.Position); }     }     base.Update(gameTime); }     The idea is to load all of the releases into a Vector2 list. Then (during the draw code) a function checks for a release to do stuff.    bool released = false; foreach (TouchLocation tl in touchPositions) {     // checks to see if the button is being hovered on      } foreach (Vector2 tr in touchReleases) {     if (PointInArea(tr, new Rectangle((int)position.X, (int)position.Y, buttonimage[0].Width, buttonimage[0].Height))) { released = true; break; } } return released;     The PointInArea function checks to see if a Vector2 is in a Rectangle. I know this function is working right.    Whats funny is that the buttons respond to releases about once every 4 taps. Does anyone know why this is? ",["c#","xna","multi-touch"]]
["Angular js unit test mock document"," I am trying to test angular service which does some manipulations to DOM via $document service with jasmine.  Let's say it simply appends some directive to the  body  element.     Such service could look like    (function(module) {     module.service('myService', [         '$document',         function($document) {             this.doTheJob = function() {                 $document.find('body').append(' my-directive  /my directive ');             };         }     ]); })(angular.module('my-app'));     And I want to test it like this    describe('Sample test' function() {     var myService;      var mockDoc;      beforeEach(function() {         module('my-app');          // Initialize mock somehow.

["Image won't draw, Canvas+double Buffering+Buffered Image used"," Okay, so here's the deal: I'm trying to simply draw an object (in this case a tornado) onto my main canvas. I'm using JFrames, a canvas, a buffer strategy, and a buffered image to draw on. As far as I can figure I'm using the  game loop  correctly and from what I've been previously able to find my order of operations in the rendering is correct. Is there some thing I'm missing about the nature of using buffer strategies perhaps? I can't tell why i get just a grey screen.

["How to get started on this project?"," I'm struggling to understand the instructions for my project, english is my second language so can someone help break it down and assist me in how i would go about this project?    Project Summary     Write a program that produces statistics for a baseball team.       Instructions:      Create the BaseballStats class:      It has two instance variables:         teamName, a String         battingAverages,  an arrays of doubles representing the batting averages of all the players on the team.      The class has the following API:      Constructor:        public BaseballStats( String filename )     The team name and the batting averages for the team are stored in the file. You can assume the first item in the file is the team name (one word – no spaces), followed by exactly 20 batting averages. Your constructor should read the file into the teamName instance variable and the battingAverages array.    Methods:     public String getTeamName( )     accessor for teamName   public void setTeamName( String newTeamName )     mutator for teamName   public double maxAverage( )    returns the highest batting average   public double minAverage( )    returns the lowest batting average   public double spread( )    returns the difference between the highest and lowest batting averages   public int goodPlayers( )    returns the number of players with an average higher than .300   public String toString( )      returns a String containing the team name followed by all the batting averages formatted to three decimal places.       Client class:      Your client should instantiate an object of the BaseballStats class, passing the name of the text file containing the team name and the averages. The client should then call all methods, reporting the results as output.   ",["java","constructor","client","project","java-7"]]

["Caching HTTP responses when they are dynamically created by PHP"," I think my question seems pretty casual but bear with me as it gets interesting (at least for me :)).    Consider a PHP page that its purpose is to read a requested file from filesystem and echo it as the response. Now the question is how to enable cache for this page? The thing to point out is that the files can be pretty huge and enabling the cache is to save the client from downloading the same content again and again.    The ideal strategy would be using the  If-None-Match  request header and  ETag  response header in order to implement a reverse proxy cache system. Even though I know this far, I'm not sure if this is possible or what should I return as response in order to implement this technique! ",["php","caching","http-headers"]]

["A case of a making-change (sort of). Find the minimal composition of weights"," TLDR: (part 1) Need to print out the best composition of weights to reach a target weight. (part 2) Don't know what approach to choose. (part 3) Also, recursion is not my friend.    I am not asking for a solution, I am just looking for a direction.    PART 1   Some text first.    The input to the program is:      a number of weights   weights themselves        target weights I am supposed to compose    There always has to be a weight that = 1, so all the weights can be composed exactly. I am supposed to print out the optimal composition of weights, for example     number of weights: 4   weights: 1, 3, 7, 10   target weight: 4   output: 2 x 7    PART 2      The first thing that came to my mind was the unbounded knapsack problem, where I would set all the values for weights to  1  and then I'd look for the lowest possible value in the knapsack. The problem is, my programming skills don't reach that level and my googling skills failed me when I wanted to find a fine article/code/video/whatever to understand it.    Then someone pointed out the making-change problem. The problem there is that it usually uses an array and I am expecting really large numbers, I cannot afford to alloc an array of size = target weight. Also, it seems to require quite a lot of magic if I want not only the lowest possible number of weights, but the exact counts.    My solution now, shall I?     sort the weights in descending order   count the number of weights yielded from the greedy algorithm   remove one biggest weight used and try to compose the weight without it   repeat 3 until I have removed all the  biggest weights  or the number of weights started to grow again    (for weights = 1, 3, 7, 10 and target = 14, greedy would give me 1 x 10 + 1 x 3 + 1 x 1, after the third step I would get (0 x 10 +) 2 x 7)    I got here. Only I need to repeat this not outside the recursive function (like I was doing until I realised it still doesn't give me the right results) but I need to move the loop into the recursive function.    PART 3     This is how parts of my code looks now:     for ( i = 0; i   weights_cnt; i ++ )     for ( j = 0; j  = weight / *(weights + i); j ++ )     {         *counter = 0;         if ( (res = greedyMagicImproved(weights + i, weight / *(weights + i) - j, weight, counter, min)) == 0 || min   *counter ) break;         else min = *counter;     }     It's a mess, I know. (the first recursive function I've ever written, sorry for that)    int greedyMagicImproved (int * weights, int limit, int weight, int * counter, int min) {     if ( *counter   min ) return 0;     else if ( weight % *weights == 0 )     {         printf ( %d * %d\\n , limit, *weights);         *counter += limit;         return *counter;     }     else if ( weight == 0 ) return *counter;     else if ( weight / *weights )     {                    printf ( %d * %d +  , limit, *weights);         *counter += limit;         return (greedyMagicImproved(weights + 1, (weight - *weights * limit) / *(weights + 1), (weight - *weights * limit) % *weights, counter, min));     }     else return greedyMagicImproved(weights + 1, weight / *(weights + 1), weight, counter, min);      }     This one produces something like this:    Number of weights: 8 Actual weights of weights: 1 2 4 5 10 20 60 95 Weights to be composed: 124 GREEDY = 1 * 95 + 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 4 IMP = 1 * 95 + 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 4 2 * 60 + 1 * 4 6 * 20 + 1 * 4 ... some more irrelevant results I'll deal with later 28 GREEDY = 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 IMP = 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 1 * 20 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 2 * 10 + 1 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 5 * 5 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 ... some more results as well     While I get to see the correct result in the first case, I do not in the second. So basically, my question is: Should I try to move the loop part into the recursion (and write it basically all over again because I have no idea how to do it) or should I go stealing/packing and making change?

If the textbox is not null, then that means the user input a value, in which case, a call to the XML tag is made and updates the existing content to the user input. It then calls the printNames() function which outputs the new contents.    When I test this, I get the original names output, but the update button doesn't do anything.

["Java Serializable Object fails"," I am having an issue with writing a Serializable object to a file.  I have been able to narrow the problem down, but have no idea what would cause this, so I'm just looking for advice anyone may have, because I can't really give an example, but I will give some shell code to paint the picture.    Basically I have an object storing information about the program that I save by writing the object to file.  It has a DefaultComboBoxModel which is part of what is causing my issue.  For example:    public class ProgramInfo implements Serializable {      private DefaultComboBoxModel model = new DefaultComboBoxModel();      // A bunch of other stuff       public DefaultComboBoxModel getModel() {          return model;      }      public void setModel(DefaultComboBoxModel m) {          model = m;      } }     Then, I have a class which extends JPanel and looks like this:    public class SomePanel extends JPanel {     private SomeOtherClass someOtherClass = new SomeOtherClass();     private ProgramInfo programInfo;     // A bunch of other stuff      public SomePanel(ProgramInfo info) {         programInfo = info;         initGUI();     }      private void initGUI() {         JComboBox box = new JComboBox(programInfo.getModel());     } }     This works fine if I only have one instance of SomePanel in my program, but if I create a second instance of SomePanel, it throws a java.io.NotSerializableException on the object SomeOtherClass when trying to write ProgramInfo to file.  If I comment out SomeOtherClass, then the next object in the SomePanel class throws the same error when trying to write ProgramInfo to file.  However, if I comment out the line  JComboBox box = new JComboBox(programInfo.getModel());  in initGUI, everything works perfectly.    As a note, I am not an expert programmer, it is just a hobby and I am completely self taught.  Any advice/reading material on why this could happen would be great.  Thanks in advance!

["What is a use case for a generic constructor?"," Consider the following constructor for the class Foo (which for the sake of clarity is not a generic class):    public  T  Foo(T obj) { }     This is valid syntax for constructors, just like with normal generic methods.    But what is the use of this syntax? Typically generic methods provide type safety for their return type, and can benefit from type inference by the compiler. For example:    Pair String, Integer  stringInt = Pair.of( asfd , 1234);     But a call to a constructor always returns an instance of its declaring class, so its type parameters have no effect on the return type. The constructor above could just be replaced with its erasure:    public Foo(Object obj) { }     Of course generics aren't only about type safety for return types. The constructor might just want to constrain the type of argument(s) being passed in. However, the above reasoning still applies for a bounded type parameter:    public  N extends Number  Foo(N number) { }  public Foo(Number number) { } //same thing     Even nested type parameters with bounds are handled using wildcards:    public  N extends Number, L extends List N   Foo(L numList) { }  public Foo(List ? extends Number  numList) { } //same thing     So what is a legitimate use case for having a generic constructor?

This structure is mandatory (I think) as explained in the illustrations below.     nav role= navigation        ul id= main-menu  class= nav top-nav clearfix            li id= menu-item-1  class= menu-item   a href= #  Menu 1 /a  /li           li id= menu-item-2  class= menu-item   a href= #  Menu 2 /a  /li           li id= menu-item-3  class= menu-item   a href= #  Menu 3 /a  /li       /ul       ul id= sub-menu-1  class= sub-menu nav clearfix            li class= menu-item   a href= #  Sub Menu 1.1 /a  /li           li class= menu-item   a href= #  Sub Menu 1.2 /a  /li           li class= menu-item   a href= #  Sub Menu 1.3/a  /li       /ul       ul id= sub-menu-2  class= sub-menu nav clearfix            li class= menu-item   a href= #  Sub Menu 2.1 /a  /li           li class= menu-item   a href= #  Sub Menu 2.2 /a  /li           li class= menu-item   a href= #  Sub Menu 2.3/a  /li       /ul   /nav      To get a better idea of what I am trying to achieve I've made the following illustrations:     Simple menu with items arranged with inline blocks. As you can see, the menu scales to 100% of the container and has all the items arranged in center.        When hovering over a menu item which has a submenu. In the illustration that's Menu 1 which has Sub Menu 1 and it needs to display it on mouse hover, like a simple  ul  li  ul  /ul  /li  /ul  would do. As you can see the submenu has to scale to 100% of the container and has all the items arranged in center.       I think the best approach is with javascript (not sure you can do this with only CSS), but I am kind off stuck. The sub menu appears on main menu item hover, but as soon as I hover out into the sub menu in order to navigate, the sub menu disappears. Anyway, this is the javascript:    $('nav #main-menu .menu-item a').hover(     function() {         var id = $(this).parent().attr('id');         id = id.substr(id.length - 1);         submenu = $('#sub-menu-' + id);         submenu.show();     },      function() {         var id = $(this).parent().attr('id');         id = id.substr(id.length - 1);         submenu = $('#sub-menu-' + id);         submenu.hide();     } );     I am pretty sure that there is a better way to do this.    I've also set up a FIDDLE for better understanding. ",["javascript","jquery","html","drop-down-menu","menu"]]

I've installed python and mapnik following the instructions on their respective sites as best I can understand, but when I try to import mapnik via python in Terminal I get an ImportError. Can anyone more experienced tell me how to fix the problem? It looks to me like it's calling a different version of python (if I just type python in Terminal instead of /usr/local/bin/python it returns 2.6), but I don't know what to do about that or where I went wrong in the installation process.

I also noticed an error at the end of the Python install:    Error: Permission denied - /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sitecustomize.py     This message re-appeared at the end of the mapnik install. Perhaps neither of these installed properly? When I do mapnik-config -v it says 2.2.0. When I do python --version, it says 2.7.5. When I look in /usr/local/bin I can see these files: mapnik-config, mapnik-speed-check. I do not see any mapnik files when I look in /usr/bin.    UPDATE 2: IT WORKED! I just had to re-do the 'enable python bindings' thing in the mapnik README.txt file (I reset to my home directory first, not sure if that matters). This:    py_version=$(python -c  import sys;print('%s.%s' % (sys.version_info[0],sys.version_info[1])) )     export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python${py_version}/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH     Seems to be working.

["upper IE 8 does not IE Embedded WinForm"," I know that It doensn't work. But It's so late to develop another project.    I just want to know how to excute it on Windows 8 and IE 11     whether direct way or indirect way. It's OK.    I'm almost crazy 'cause of this problem.    for a long time I coudn't find any information on searching.    Microsoft said ..        IEHost.dll is the runtime host that provides the ability to host   Windows Forms controls and run executables in IE. IEHost is a .Net 1.1   technology that provided a better model than ActiveX to host controls   within the browser since they were lightweight and the controls   operated under the .NET security model, where they operated inside a   sandbox.          For Dev10, the proposal is to remove IEHost.dll for the following   reasons            IEHost/HREF-EXEs are surface area exposed to the Internet. This poses a high security risk (we already have bugs filed related to   this), and most customers (by far) who install the Framework are   getting very little value for this security risk. If IEHost and IEExec   is left as-is, a new model needs to be designed where either (a) using   this technology is safe and is always on, or (b) is as secure as today   and can be configured to be turned off. The cost of doing this is very   high.         Customers who want IEHost/HREF-EXE-sytle controls or apps have numerous other technologies they can use, like ClickOnce, XBAP,   Silverlight.          Customers who want the exact same functionality as 3.5 SP1 for this feature can continue to use 3.5 SP1. This change, of removing   IEHost takes effect only in .Net Framework 4.0.         The opportunity cost and risk of continuing to support this feature for the CLR team is high. Going forward, we will be able to   deliver more features and bug fixes that benefit more of our customers   if we can remove this from NetFx4.       ",["winforms","internet-explorer"]]

["Include editable=false fields in ModelFormSet"," I have a Django model with a *created_on* field set to editable=false. This is the correct behavior because I have also set auto_now=True and per the documentation:    * As currently implemented, setting auto_now or auto_now_add to True will cause the field to have editable=False and blank=True set. *    Using the admin, you can define any fields you have set to editable=flase as readonly_fields in the ModelAdmin and everything will work as expected (i.e., the fields will show up in the form, but they will be grayed out).    However, when working with a ModelFormSet in an app (i.e., not the admin), I cannot figure out how to show the created_on field in the forms. Per the documentation:     Django applies the following rule: if you set editable=False on the model field, any form created from the model via ModelForm will not include that field.     Does anybody know of a way to override/circumvent that behavior?    I would rather not set editable=True because it is a constraint I want to maintain at the most basic level.

["Extract text from HTML while preserving block-level element newlines"," Background    Most questions about extracting text from HTML (i.e., stripping the tags) use:    jQuery( htmlString ).text();     While this abstracts browser inconsistencies (such as innerText vs. textContent), the function call also ignores the semantic meaning of block-level elements (such as li).    Problem    Preserving newlines of block-level elements (i.e., the semantic intent) across various browsers entails no small effort, as Mike Wilcox describes.    A seemingly simpler solution would be to emulate pasting HTML content into a  textarea , which strips HTML while preserving block-level element newlines. However, JavaScript-based inserts do not trigger the same HTML-to-text routines that browsers employ when users paste content into a  textarea .    I also tried integrating Mike Wilcox's JavaScript code. The code works in Chromium, but not in Firefox.    Question    What is the simplest cross-browser way to extract text from HTML while preserving semantic newlines for block-level elements using jQuery (or vanilla JavaScript)?    Example    Consider:     Select and copy this entire question.   Open the textarea example page.   Paste the content into the textarea.    The textarea preserves the newlines for ordered lists, headings, preformatted text, and so forth. That is the result I would like to achieve. ",["javascript","jquery","html","text","strip"]]

The formatter is like this: (it basically has a NSNumber value representing an enum, and displays the name of the enum instead)    I just need the auto complete to work again    - (NSArray *)comboBoxValues {     NSMutableArray *mArray = [NSMutableArray array];     for (int i = 0 ; i self.enums.count ; ++i)     {         [mArray addObject:@(i)];     }      return mArray; }  - (NSString *)stringForObjectValue:(id)obj {     if ([obj intValue]   [self.enums count])     {         return self.enums[[obj intValue]];     }      return @ Something's wrong ; }  - (BOOL)getObjectValue:(out __autoreleasing id *)obj              forString:(NSString *)string       errorDescription:(out NSString *__autoreleasing *)error {     for (NSString *enumString in self.enums)     {         if ([enumString hasPrefix:string])         {             *obj = @([self.enums indexOfObject:enumString]);             return YES;         }     }      return NO; }  ",["objective-c","osx","cocoa","nscombobox","nsformatter"]]

["Copy memory from char* to a location in larger char*"," I am trying to create code that places half a dozen variables into a char* and they are almost all multi-byte variables. Since they are all going into the same char* I'd like to be able to copy the data into the char* as easily as possible.    If there is no  standard  way for me to do this, I can easily make an inline function that deals with this for me. I was, however, hoping there would be a simple way of doing this, perhaps like:    memcpy(char* target, char* source, int target_start_position, int source_length)    So to elaborate on that: I'd be copying all the data from source, into target. I'd copy the data to target[target_start_position] Then source_length would merely be for the function to know how much data it is going to be reading from the source.     What I actually tried. Perhaps you can see what my thought process was however.    =================    This is as simple as I was hoping to get things: (Which I realize doesn't work because I am assigning pointers as values)    char* data; unsigned __int64 pos = 0;  int string_len = sName.size(); unsigned __int64 data_size = sizeof(string_len) + string_len + (sizeof(int) * 10) + 3; data = new char[data_size];  data[pos] = (char const*)(&amp;string_len); pos += sizeof(string_len);  data[pos] = (char const*)(&amp;sName); pos += string_len;  data[pos] = (char const*)(&amp;iStatPoints); pos += sizeof(int);     Note: I apologize for the title, that was the most precise way of describing the issue I could think of.

["Which is the best solution between array or vector in C++"," Please help me to solve this problem in efficient way in C++.     On the New Year Eve a government of one country decided to send a train with gifts to each town of the country. For each N towns exactly one wagon with gifts was sent. The route was organized in such way that at each place  the last wagon would be detached, then in the next place the other last one and so on. Just before the departure it turned out that the loading workers did not pay attention to numeration of the wagons and loaded the gifts into the wagons in random order. It was impossible to detach a wagon from the middle of the train and there was a no time to rearrange gifts.    Luckily there was a depot with parallel tracks. At the entrance of the depot each wagon could be directed to any of the tracks, and wagons could leave the depot from the other side in the right sequences: 1,2,3,4 and so on.    For example, if at the entrance of the depot with three parallel tracks there were six wagons standing in order: 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 3 then wagon 2,5,6 could be directed to the first track: wagon 1, 4 to the second track, wagon 3 to the third track could be directed respectively. In this case wagons could leave the depot in the right order.    Fortunately there were enough tracks in the depot to rearrange the train.    Input The first line output file must contain N and M - the number of wagons in the train and the number of tracks in the depot respectively (1 =N =800 000, 1 =M =100 000). The second line contains N integers - sequence of wagons before the entrance to the depot. It's guranteed that solution always exists.    Output On the first line output file must contain N integers - which track should be chosen for each wagon from input data. On the second line of output file write the number of tracks in order the wagons should leave the depot in the sequence 1,2,3 and so on.

["Dynamic LINQ select from relational tables"," I have a db that has a central table, with more than 30 tables referenced by a FK.  An entry will always have a row in the main table, and depending on the type of information, may be in 1 or 2 (I currently can't think of any scenario where it is in more than 2) of the associated tables.    Depending on the customer, only the tables that are being populated are represented to the end user, and they can dynamically choose which columns of information are returned to them.    I am using Entity Framework to access the records and have found a speed dilemma with all of the referenced tables.  If I just do something like:    var v = from r in context.Records select r;     When it does the query, it is also doing a sub query for each individual associated table, whether it has entries or not.  When on a local lan that is in good shape, its fast, but has a noticeable delay.  When remotely running these queries, it can take most of a second per record to run all the associated queries.  A sample of the associated queries is at the bottom of this post.  I created an entity model that only had a handful of tables instead of the full set for demo purposes and got the log output from EF.  I only pasted the output from 1 record query set.    As such, my thought was to use linq to put together something along the lines of    var v = from r in context.Records         select new { ID = r.ID, val1 = r.val1, val2=r.val2, val3 = r.child_table1.val1, r.child_table1.val2 };     This did exactly what I wanted as far as removing the overhead of the unneeded queries and removed the performance issue....(here comes where I'm currently stuck).    However, the child_table and column names are the part that has to be dynamic.  I will always be pulling the columns for the main table, but I need to dynamically create the portion of the select that relates to the columns off of the related table.    For example, a customer may only have 3 child tables that are being populated and therefore the rest are not needed.  But as we have many customers across the world, everyone is different so it's not practical to code up every possible scenario, nor maintainable as we are always updating/adding as we need to handle new things.    So for my normal scenario, I need 2-4 child tables, and all of the columns for each.  I can govern what columns are presented from the ui.  The biggest challenge is only querying the child tables that actually have rows in them.    Hopefully I'm overthinking this and someone will give me an aha moment.    Any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated.

MemRef is a small object containing a char* and a size_t length.      I'm using GCC 4.4.7 with --std=g++0x so I get some c++ features, including emplace_back() which is nice for avoiding constructors and copying.

["Visual Studio 2010 says Build failed with no errors after I change a source file"," I have a Visual Studio 2010 solution with a few projects. I can successfully build with Build -  Build Solution or Build -  Build MyCompany.MyProduct.MyProject. After building I press CTRL+F5 and successfully run the start up project.

I am still able to press CTRL+F5 and run the startup project. This again works as expected.    The problem is in the following scenario: After I change a source file, save it and directly press CTRL+F5 then Visual Studio 2010 says BUILD FAILED and there are no errors.

["GDB: Ctrl+C doesn't interrupt process as it usually does"," Normally when you run a program through GDB you can press Ctrl+C to interrupt it, e.g. if it gets stuck in an infinite loop and you want to get a backtrace.    I'm debugging a program (xmms2d as it happens) but in this program only, when I press Ctrl+C it gets treated as if GDB was not running - the program shuts down cleanly and then GDB tells me the program exited normally.    How do I get the usual GDB behaviour back, where Ctrl+C interrupts the program?  Or is there another way to produce the same reaction in GDB as a Ctrl+C normally does? ",["gdb","signals"]]
["Any problems with this exception handling approach?"," We need to have two functions. They do the same thing but one handles the exceptions and one throws the exception.  Note: If to handle exception, the exception has to be handled in the commonFunc() below. It would not work to handle the exception in functionHandlesEx() because to handle the function it needs the variable only available in commonFunc().  In order to re-use code, we got the following.   Do you see any problem with it (I can see one problem is: the function throws exception but actually no exception is thrown when isExceptionHandled is true----but Java allows this)?  Any better way to do this?  We are in Java 6.  Thanks.    public void functionThrowsEx() throws Exception e {   commonFunc(false);  //false means does not handle exception }  public void functionHandlesEx() {   try   {     commonFunc(true); //true means handle exception   }   catch (Exception e)   {     // do nothing as exception handled   } }  private void commonFunc(final boolean isExceptionHandled) throws Exception {   try   {     ....   }   catch (Exception e)   {     if (isExceptionHandled)     {        //handle the exception     }     else     {        throw e;     }   } }  ",["java","exception"]]

["TransactionScope Timeout overriden"," I've dug around all over for this I can't quite understand what I am seeing. This is not code that I wrote, so I am trying to understand what is going on. The bare bones are here :    (action() is an Action object passed in. Basically something like this () =  sp.BalanceAccounts(dto)         try      {         TransactionOptions transactionOptions = new TransactionOptions();        transactionOptions.IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted;        transactionOptions.Timeout = new TimeSpan(0, 0, 1); //added as a test        sw.Start(); //this is a timer I added to check timeout        using (TransactionScope scope = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.Required, transactionOptions))            {              action();               scope.Complete();                                }            sw.Stop();       } catch (Exception ex)       {           sw.Stop();           Do some stuff       }     The issue is that when the action passed in involves a sqlDataAdapter, the timeout period seems to be that for the SelectCommand.CommandTimeout, not the one set for the TransactionScope.  I added the explicit Timeout setting to try and see what was going on.     In my limited understanding, I though the timeout period would be for the TransactionScope and it would drop to the catch block if this time was exceeded.    If I run a known long running query through that uses the sqlDataAdapter, and set the CommandTimeout to 18 seconds(so it's obvious), then the stopwatch in the catch block above shows just over 18 seconds. If I run something else through as the action which is a bit slow, that does not use the sqlDataAdapter, then the timer in the catch block shows just over 1 second (which is what I set as the transaction scope timeout). Is it just that the transaction is timing out at 1 second anyway, but it can't drop through to the catch block until the sqlDataAdapter times out as well ?  I fixed the long running query in the sqlDataAdapter, so it doesn't time out anymore, but am left with this slightly bigger picture puzzle.    Many thaks in advance for any tips !

Thats an increase of 74026%    57 KiloBytes - nth    (ns fooModule) (let [log js/console.log     x (array 5)]     (log (nth x 0)))     77 Bytes - aget    (ns fooModule) (let [log js/console.log     x (array 5)]     (log (aget x 0)))     The code generated by aget is very readable. (formatting put in by hand)    ;(function(){     var a=console.log,         b=[5];     a.a ? a.a(b[0]) : a.call( null, b[0] ); })();     generated nth code in a gist https://gist.github.com/trashhalo/7781298\\    clojurescript 0.0-2014 ",["javascript","clojure","clojurescript"]]

I don't have to have huge if else blocks as the data in the int[] (don't worry about the DataStuff class that is just a simple example) will all be generated based on a query (also not shown in the above code) that will be provided by the implementation, so the dev will know what he is expecting back (by developer I mean me anyway lol...).

["deploy to production from master or hotifx?"," We are adopting Git on the company after some years of SVN usage. The git flow suits our needs very well with the master/hotfix/develop/release branches. So far everything is going well, apart from a conundrum. Our project is a Java app for weblogic, we produce a WAR file on the project build.    The context is:     We have master as the trunk that holds code that goes to production   A new hotfix is branched out of master   Developers commit on hotfix   QA tests hotfix   A binary is approved QA-wise    The big question is:     Should we deploy the binary from hotfix to production?   Or should we merge to master, build from there, test and then deploy to production?    I understood that master would be the branch that would hold the code that goes to production. So I have an issue with deploying from hotfix. However deploying from master would mean 2 QA cycles on the same codebase as the 2 builds (on hotfix and master) might produce different binaries depending on maven dependencies/build environment/... And 2 QA cycles on the same codebase is a waste of resources.    I searched the web and found little reference about this. Here and there I see people saying they deploy from master, while others deploy from hotfix. The thing is that people who deploy from master usually are on a parsed language project (PHP, Perl, ...) so they don't have the binary to consider.    Does any of you faced this issue already? What approach did you take?    Thanks in advance! ",["java","git","deployment","git-flow"]]

["How do file-systems implement sector-locking?"," Though this is a general question, specific answers for any of the Windows- or Linux- or Mac- supported file-system(s) are welcome.    How does a file-system prevent 2 or more processes from concurrent read/write access to a sector of a local drive?     I understand that some type of sector-locking would obviously need to be employed, but...      What would be the 'type' of this OS-wide sector lock:    a) Named-mutex / named-semaphore / file-mapping ? (on Windows)    b) Shared memory ? (on Linux)     Where is this sector-lock kept: In memory? On disk? In either case, wherever this lock is stored, I understand that...    a) the storage for locks has to be a logically-temporary storage, since the lock should not be left dangling permanently or indefinitely if its owner process were to crash. So, it helps if these locks exist in memory.    b) the whereabouts of the lock have to be publicly discoverable by all processes via a name or ID which found a function of the sector number. So, if process A needs to lock sector S, A should know how to first get access to the lock L(S) for sector S, create L(S) if it does not already exist, try to lock L(S), and either return or block -- all atomically, since another process B could also be racing alongside A trying to carry out the same sequence of steps.     For a large storage device, the number of sectors would be large too. So, a lock each for each sector cannot obviously be pre-allocated either in memory or on disk.     What I don't know or understand, however, is how this problem is already handled by ext* file-systems on Linux, FAT* and NTFS on Windows, and likewise for Mac.    The actual context of my questions: Ultimately, I have to apply the answers to the above for a Java-based, custom file-system that I'm writing using Java 7 NIO2 FileSystemProvider, where 2 or more independent Java processes could be accessing a bunch of sectors of the attached drive for reading/writing . In Java 7, the only non-JNI way that I know of to achieve shared memory between processes is via a MappedByteBuffer. But the problem is, this byte buffer would be 'raw' memory - whereas what I need is an OS-wide, mutex-type mechanism AND also probably a mutex each for each sector S. It seems, my changes to this MappedByteBuffer won't get carried out atomically OS-wide unless I also call MappedByteBuffer.force.    Would greatly appreciate all answers and comments.

The user then has to re-select the date from the datepicker to avoid encountering an(other) error.     When I add datetime validation to the field in the /Model/Model.php file, I get a format validation error. Here's the code I use to validate the format (one of many permutations used in both the controller and model to test between dmy, ymd, ddmmyyyy, yyyymmdd format):    'issue_date'=  array(     'allowEmpty' =  array(         'rule'    =  'notEmpty',         'message'  =  'Please enter a date and time'     ),     'format' =  array(         'rule' =  array('datetime', 'dmy'),         'message'  =  'Please enter a valid date'     ) ),      When I remove the date format validation, the form posts fine, and the (correct) datetime is committed to the database.    I've also tried adding the following strtotime in the controller without resolving the issue:    if (isset($this- request- data['Model']['issue_date'])) {     $this- request- data['Model']['issue_date'] = date('d-m-Y', strtotime($this- request- data['Model']['issue_date'])); }     I've also looked in to using the DateBehavior provided in the bakery with no success - it formats the dates correctly in views, but problems 1 and 2 still exist.

["Creating a text-item carousel with Twitter Boostrap 3"," I'm using Bootstrap 3 for my latest website. I've used the Carousel element in several places throughout the site and it's working great. However, one of of the requirements is a slider of  key people  within the business and it needs to work a bit differently.       I envisage it working like so: you click one of the arrows, the carousel of the names scrolls across one (using CSS3 transitions for a smooth transition between the colour, size and position) so that the new name is in the centre position. At this point, the content of the grey div below quickly fades out and then fades in with the new person profile.    I was wondering whether anyone could see an easy way to achieve this with Bootstrap, or if I was better just writing my own plugin?    Edit: I know that I can use the slid.bs.carousel event to trigger the change in the person profile to whichever has been selected. It's really just the carousel-style transition of the text elements which I am unsure about...    Thanks :) ",["jquery","slider","twitter-bootstrap-3","carousel"]]

["Dynamic allocation using memory locations already in use"," I have an extraction operator being used for a class that has a char* member 'name'.

Here is the definition of the operator:    ifstream&amp; operator  (ifstream&amp; fin, Player&amp; currentPlayer){    char* temp = new char[50];    char tempChar;    fin    temp;    // importing from a file that contains names of about 6 characters each    stringCopy(currentPlayer.name, temp);    delete[] temp;    temp = NULL;    return fin;    }     stringCopy body:     void stringCopy(char *destPtr, const char *sourcePtr){      while(*sourcePtr!='\\0'){         *destPtr = *sourcePtr;         destPtr++;         sourcePtr++;         }      *destPtr='\\0';      }     I have been debugging by printing out the memory addresses being used for temp and the name.    The FIRST time the extraction operator is called, the player's name and the temp array have different memory addresses, which is what should happen. Then temp is then deleted and set to NULL, which I confirmed by printing the address (and getting '0'), and the address of the player's name remains after the function has returned.    However, on subsequent calls, the address of both temp AND the player's name become identical to the address of the first player's name. The name address SHOULD be the same, as it is the same object that is just being overwritten, but why is temp getting the SAME address as  name  if it is allocated with the new char[] keywords?    Here is some code I used when debugging:    Along each step of the way in the body of the operator:    cout     temp address followed by name address:      (void*)temp           (void*)(currentPlayer.name)    endl;    In the main driver:    cout     player      i+1      has been extracted with name address      (void*)(tempPlayer.name)    endl;    Here is the Player constructor:    Player::Player(){    name = new char[50];    stringCopy(name, name );    ID = new int[5];    }     Excluding irrelevant data members, here is Player definition:    class Player{    public:       char* name; };  ",["c++","memory","dynamic"]]

Then in each country the same rule should apply for towns.    I can sort the list of these parameters by Alpha-Numeric order so it can be assumed that they are sorted    The story why I might need this: I can create/delete country objects and towns in html form.  If I create 2 countries and then delete the first one input parameter(index) of the remaining country would be 1 since 0 is deleted. when it goes to server side, this country is being mapped to list index 1 and for the first (index) it creates empty country object. It gives me problems and I thought I could rearrange the order of the input parameters so I could avoid  blank  list items automatically bound from request.    How I generate inputs:     when I delete town I delete inputs as well. So when I submit a form, whatever is in request parameters is bound to the java objects structure and what is missing is populated with the elements with default constructor. ",["java"]]

["fitting forms to various screen settings in ms access 2010"," I have a set of two nested navigation subforms in an ms access 2010 database.

["Google plus like StaggeredGridView"," I have been looking for a way to achieve Google plus like gridview and came across to this post. Android Column GridView, variable width like GooglePlus App    What I want is exactly same as Google plus except the content inside of grid, either 1 large image, or 2 equal-width small images.

["SQlite query not working when selecting integers in 1000s"," I'm using c#, winforms, SQlite as my database.    I'm running the following query:    string sql14 =  select YYMM, TotalTrans  from t2 where CAST(TotalTrans as int)   500000 and CAST(TotalTrans as int)   1000 ;     I then use this query to populate 2 lists, which I then export to a menustrip where the user can select it like this:    string sql14 =  select YYMM, TotalTrans  from t2 where CAST(TotalTrans as int)    500000 and CAST(TotalTrans as int)   1000 ; SQLiteCommand cmd5 = new SQLiteCommand(sql14, sqlite_conn);   SQLiteDataReader rdr5 = cmd5.ExecuteReader();  while (rdr5.Read()) {    int TotalTranst22;   DateTime yyyymmt22;    if (DateTime.TryParse(rdr5[ YYMM ].ToString(), out yyyymmt22) &amp;&amp; int.TryParse(rdr5[ TotalTrans ].ToString(), out TotalTranst22))   {       // Populating the lists        YYMMt22.Add(yyyymmt22);       TotalTransIrregularitiest22.Add(TotalTranst22);   } }     Problem: When I select the option to show the contents of the 2 lists      YMMt22 and TotalTransIrrefularitiest22, nothing happens. While trying to debug I found out that the lists are completely empty, i.e: the query isn't working.    Update:    The problem arises when I try to run the query for values   1000, as they have a ','  in them.     Also, when trying a user suggestion (below)    SELECT CAST(TotalTrans as int) FROM t2`     I get an error saying the index was out of bounds of array in the condition of my if statement     Here is the actual data I'm trying to store in the lists via the query. As you can see, it does have thousands separators (the commas).         Just for the record: I know this process of querying my table works because I used a similar query to get values  1000 (notice they dont have a ',') and it worked perfectly. Here's the code for that:    // Total Trans tolerance  1000  string sql13 =  select YYMM, TotalTrans  from t2 where cast(TotalTrans as int)   1000 ;     Update:    Tried a user solution... still no luck. The lists dont get filled with any data        string sql14 =  select YYMM, TotalTrans  from t2 where CAST(REPLACE(TotalTrans, ',', '') as int)   500000 and CAST(REPLACE(TotalTrans, ',', '') as int)   1000 ;         SQLiteCommand cmd5 = new SQLiteCommand(sql14, sqlite_conn);           SQLiteDataReader rdr5 = cmd5.ExecuteReader();          while (rdr5.Read())         {              int TotalTranst22;               DateTime yyyymmt22;             if (DateTime.TryParse(rdr5[ YYMM ].ToString(), out yyyymmt22) &amp;&amp; int.TryParse(rdr5[ TotalTrans ].ToString(), out TotalTranst22))             {                 YYMMt22.Add(yyyymmt22);                 TotalTransIrregularitiest22.Add(TotalTranst22);             }         }  ",["c#","sqlite"]]

["Write own dependency injection"," we are developing an application. The application will be deployed in a proprietary event processing engine. We are not supposed to use any api such as spring core for DI. There are not proprietary DI frameworks yet. So the idea is to write one and a simple one.    Can any one please provide some inputs.    My idea is to write a factory class which has static methods in it. The static methods will return instances of the classes we want. For now we only want a single instance. I am assuming the below kind of code    public final class MyFactory {      private static ClassA classA = new ClassA();     private static ClassB classB = new ClassB();      private MyFactory() {         throw new CustomException( Cannot create instance );     }      public static ClassA getClassAInstance() {         return classA;     }      public static ClassB getClassBInstance() {         return classB;     } }     Later I will use it like this    public class SomeRandomClass {      private ClassA classA = MyFactory.getClassAInstance(); }     Other thing I see is I need not test ClassA and ClassB. Testing SomeRandomClass will cover ClassA and ClassB. Because static content is always loaded first. So while testing SomeRandomClass I always have ClassA instance in it. So writing a junit on some method in SomeRandomClass will invoke methods in ClassA. Is this good?    Is it the right way I am doing? Can I improve it even? ",["java","spring","dependency-injection"]]

For example, Health Insurance form must be turned in 60 days from hire date. I would like the date to automatically update to be 60 days from the current date each time the presentation is ran.     I currently have a text box linked to an Excel spreadsheet which has a formula =NOW()+60. This works great, but it still does not update unless you first double click on the text box to activate/open the Excel spreadsheet, which then refreshes to the current date and updates the correct future date.

["Set focus on first invalid input in AngularJs form"," I've read several articles and StackOverflow questions relating to the setting of focus in AngularJs.    Unfortunately all the examples that I have read assume that there is some attribute that I can add to the element to gain focus, e.g. a focusMe directive.    However what if I don't know in advance which input to set focus to? In particular how do I set focus to the first input element in a form that has $invalid set - i.e. an element that fails validation.  There could be several inputs that fail validation, so I cannot use a directive that just tries to call .focus() based on this.  (I am doing this for Accessibility/WCAG reasons, its good practice to do so on submit being clicked to minimize keypresses to find the first field that has failed validation).    The $error object will give all controls that fail validation, but they are grouped by the type of failure not in any order of appearance on the form.    I'm sure I can come up with some kludged way of doing this. A directive on the form, which receives some broadcast when focus needs to be set - that directive can then search for the first $invalid element.  However this seems very complex and I'd like to know whether these is a better more 'angular' way of doing this. ",["validation","angularjs","angularjs-directive"]]

["finding subsets of length N of a list in scheme"," I wrote a function which finds all the subsets of a list already and it works. I'm trying to write a second function where I get all the subsets of N length, but it's not working very well.

(length y) n) (cons y x) x)) empty (powerset lst))]     ))    where (powerset lst) gives a list of all the subsets. Am I misunderstanding the purpose of foldr?

We have dependencies on some third-party libraries (e.g. boost, fftw, etc.) and these also get delivered and installed, so there's no need for our users to download extra components.    Right now, for the MacOS build, an app bundle is generated (MyProject.app). We're using the PackageMaker CPack Package Generator. All needed third-party dependencies get instaled under MyProject.app/Contents/Frameworks.    We recently completed a suite of command line tools that we'd like to include in our installer. So we'll be installing our bundle, MyProject.app along a folder, say, Tools, including our new command line utilities.     To make things more interesting, our application bundle is composed of some gui and core components, and we represent each component and our tools as different CMake projects (i.e., we use the following CMake commands: project(gui_components), project(core_components) and project(tools)). Our tools depend on the core components, but not on the gui components.     Basically, what we'd like to have is the following folder structure:     install folder    |   |--MyProject.app   |   |   |   |-- all MacOS bundle needed folders/files    |   |--Tools/   |   |   |   |--ToolA   |   |--ToolB   |    |--lib/       |       |--libboost_regex       |--libfftw       |--libgui_components       |--libcore_components     How can I tell CMake / CPack to install third-party dependencies (in this example: libboost_regexand libfftw) in the lib folder?

["How should I design a game character class with a large number of attributes?"," I am a student who is currently learning Java and trying to write a small text-based RPG game with it. The first problem I encountered in the design of the game is the 'character' class, which represents all the playable heroes and enemy characters, and is now implemented by myself as the following:    class RPGActor {  private String name; private int HP; // hit points private int MP; // mana private int AP; // attack private int DP; // defense  ... // followed by tens of other attributes.   public Actor(int actorID) {     ... // Reads all attributes from a file based on the 'actorID'. } public void printStatus() {     System.out.println(name);     System.out.println( HP :  + HP);      System.out.println( MP :  + MP);      ... // And print all the attributes one by one. } public void setHP(int newHP) {     HP = newHP; } public int getHP() {     return HP; } public void setMP(...) {     ... } // And tens of accessors and mutators for each attribute }     The problem I see with this design is that there are too many things that needs to be hand-coded: There are some 20-30 attributes in the class, and a separate accessor/mutator needs to be implemented for each of them. And the function for displaying the current status of the hero, printStatus, must output each attribute separately even though every line of output follows the exact same format. This makes the class definition tediously long.    Plus, if later I want to add one more attribute to the game, then I must remember to modify 'printStatus', and add a pair of accessor/mutator for it.    So my question is: is there a way to design the class so that I can use ONE pair of set/get functions to set all attributes. Something like:    public void set(String attribName, int attribVal) { ... }     and print the attributes iteratively like this:    public void printStatus() {     System.out.println(name);     for (...)

I've got a 2-player game, where each person is dealt a hand, and then needs to select two cards from their hand to discard. Discarding is done simultaneously, so players may discard at different moments or the same moment. Here's my discard function:    Game.prototype.discard = function(socket, msg) {   var self = this;   socket.get('playerNum', function (err, playerNum) {     self.crib.push(self.cards[playerNum].splice(msg.cards[0],1)[0]);     self.crib.push(self.cards[playerNum].splice(msg.cards[1]-1,1)[0]);     for (var i = 0; i   self.cards[playerNum].length; i++) //add cards kept as unpegged       self.currentUnPeggedCards.push(self.cards[playerNum][i]);     socket.broadcast.in('gamea' + self.tableNumber).emit('other player discarded');     if (self.crib.length == CARDS_PER_CRIB) { //both players discarded       var jsonGame = self.buildJSON('starter');       self.dbConnection.query( UPDATE savedgames SET game = ' +jsonGame+ ' WHERE room = 'a' and player1_id =  +self.seatedPlayers[0][2]+  and player2_id =  +self.seatedPlayers[1][2]+ ; );       if (playerNum == self.dealer)         socket.broadcast.in('gamea' + self.tableNumber).emit('cut starter card');       else         socket.emit('cut starter card');     }     else {       var jsonGame = self.buildJSON('discard');       self.dbConnection.query( UPDATE savedgames SET game = ' +jsonGame+ ' WHERE room = 'a' and player1_id =  +self.seatedPlayers[0][2]+  and player2_id =  +self.seatedPlayers[1][2]+ ; );    }   }); }     The msg param is passed in from the client side, and is built as the result of the user toggling two cards and then selecting to discard. Here's what the client-side code generating the msg looks like:    function clickedDiscard() {   if (myTurnButton) {     var discards = [];     var keepCards = [];     for (var i=0; i 6; i++) {       if (cardsClicked[i])         discards.push(i);       cardsClicked[i] = false;     }     numCardsClicked = 0;     socket.emit('discard',{cards:discards});          } }     So it pushes two cards to self.crib (which contains both player's discards), then it checks to see if both players have discarded (by looking at the length of self.crib, and then I'm building a storing a json object which represents the current state of the game, so if people get disconnected they can resume, etc.    The crash is happening in my buildJSON function. Here's the entire code for that function (as requested):     Game.prototype.buildJSON = function(state) {   console.log('starting build json');   var self = this;   var stateStr = ' state : '+state+' ,';   var scoreStr = ' score :['+self.score+'],';   var winsStr = ' wins :['+self.wins+'],';   var mostRecentPtsStr = ' mostRecentPts :['+self.mostRecentPts+'],';   var mostRecentCardPtsStr = ' mostRecentCardPts :['+self.mostRecentCardPts+'],';   var mostRecentCountStr = ' mostRecentCount :['+self.mostRecentCount+'],';   var dealerStr = ' dealer :'+self.dealer+',';   var dealsFirstStr = ' dealsFirst :'+self.dealsFirst+',';   var peggerStr = ' pegger :'+self.currentPegger+',';   var cardNamesStr = ' hands :[';   for (var i=0; i self.cards.length;i++) {     cardNamesStr += '[';     for (var j=0; j self.cards[i].length;j++) {       cardNamesStr += ' '+self.cards[i][j].getName()+' ';       if (j==self.cards[i].length-1)         cardNamesStr += ']';       else         cardNamesStr += ',';     }     if (i!=self.cards.length-1)       cardNamesStr += ',';   }   cardNamesStr += '],';   var cribStr = ' crib :[';   for (var i=0;i self.crib.length;i++) {     cribStr += ' '+self.crib[i].getName()+' ';     if (i!=self.crib.length-1)        cribStr += ',';   }   cribStr += '],';   var starterStr = '';   if (self.starterCard != null)     starterStr = ' starter : '+self.starterCard.getName()+' ,';   var deckStr = ' deck :[';   var deckCards = self.deck.getCards();   for (var i=0;i  deckCards.length;i++) {     deckStr += ' '+deckCards[i].getName()+' ';     if (i!= deckCards.length-1)         deckStr += ',';   }   deckStr += '],';   var pegCountStr = ' count :'+self.currentPeggingCount+',';   var peggedStr = ' pegged :[';   for (var i=0; i self.peggedCards.length;i++) {     peggedStr += '[';     for (var j=0; j self.peggedCards[i].length;j++) {       peggedStr += ' '+self.peggedCards[i][j].getName()+' ';       if (j!=self.peggedCards[i].length-1)         peggedStr += ',';     }     peggedStr += ']';     if (i!=self.peggedCards.length-1)       peggedStr += ',';   }   peggedStr += '],';   var currentPeggedStr = ' currentPegged :[';   for (var i=0;i self.currentPeggedCards.length;i++) {     currentPeggedStr += ' '+self.currentPeggedCards[i].getName()+' ';     if (i!=self.currentPeggedCards.length-1)         currentPeggedStr += ',';   }   currentPeggedStr += '],';   var currentUnPeggedStr = ' currentUnPegged :[';   for (var i=0;i self.currentUnPeggedCards.length;i++) {     currentUnPeggedStr += ' '+self.currentUnPeggedCards[i].getName()+' ';     if (i!=self.currentUnPeggedCards.length-1)         currentUnPeggedStr += ',';   }   currentUnPeggedStr += ']';   var gameJSON = '{' + stateStr + scoreStr + winsStr + mostRecentPtsStr + mostRecentCardPtsStr +     mostRecentCountStr + dealerStr + dealsFirstStr + peggerStr + cardNamesStr + cribStr + starterStr + deckStr + pegCountStr + peggedStr + currentPeggedStr + currentUnPeggedStr + '}';   console.log('json built');   return gameJSON; }      The crash happens on the call to getName(), with the error being: Cannot call method 'getName' of undefined    At this point, I'm not sure how this can happen. The for loop, is, by definition over the length of the object, so there has to be an element at each index in the loop. And yet, clearly there isn't, because the object is undefined. Is this somehow happening because of an async problem? When pushing to an array, does it somehow increase the length of the array before actually adding the object to the array itself? I suppose it's possible that what I'm splicing out of the original array is undefined? Pretty stumped. ",["arrays","node.js","asynchronous","logic"]]
["Best DBI method to select 30,000 rows into an array"," I am new to Perl and getting to grips with it.    This is a two phased question.    Question 1: The Perl DBI has several methods to fetch data from the database tables.

["ASP.Net MVC EF Map To Junction Table With Three Primary Keys"," I am having the hardest time figuring this out.  I am using MVC 4 and Code First Entity Framework.  I have three classes.  They are Users, Roles, and Project.  A user can have many projects and for a particular project, a user can have a particular role.  I am using a junction table to combine the three tables.  Here is an example of the Junction Table:    public class UserRolesinProject {      [Key, Column(Order = 0)]      public int UserId { get; set;}      [Key, Column(Order = 1)]      public int RoleId  { get; set;}      [Key, Column(Order = 2)]      public int ProjectId  { get; set;}  }     Here are samples of each of the classes    public class DBUser {     [Key]     public int UserId { get; set;}     public string UserName { get; set;}     public virtual ICollection  UserRolesinProject   Roles { get; set; } }  public class DBRole {     [Key]     public int RoleId { get; set;}     public string RoleName { get; set;}     public virtual ICollection  UserRolesinProject   Projects { get; set; } }  public class Project {      [Key]      public int ProjectId { get; set;}      public string ProjectName { get; set;}      public virtual ICollection  UserRolesinProject   Users { get; set; } }     Lastly a sample of the context class        Public DBSet DBUser Users {get; set;}     Public DBSet DBRoles Roles {get; set;}     Public DBSet Project Projects {get; set;}     Public DBSet UserRolesInProject UserRolesProjects {get; set;}     So at the moment this builds and the tables are created when I use the package manager console to update the database.  What I wanted to achieve was if I do a LINQ statement from the User I would like to retrieve all the projects that the User is assigned to and the respective role.  Right now, I’m just getting the ids of each field, which is from the junction table and the mapping that I did in each individual class to the junction table.  I thought the result would be they all would be joined.  What am I doing wrong?  I searched and viewed different examples, but they were all for two PK columns not three.  Are my tables wrong?  Did I set them up in an inefficient way?  Thanks in advance for the help. ",["c#","asp.net","sql","asp.net-mvc","entity-framework"]]

["How to avoid conflict in GIT"," Background: We are using GIT as a PHP deploy system (in addition to SCM features). Once we have a stable source code version, we launch a script that is executed in the production server to synchronize with the latest version. This production server has two branches:     master: that's the latest version of the source code without any production customization.   pro: that's a master child branch that only exists in this production server and has some small changes necessary to run the app in the given server (i.e. database access data, server name, etc).    NOTE: The main repository has more branches and programmers have more branches, but the only branch used in production is master, the other are ignored and not synchronized.    The problem: There are about 100 copies of the source code in different servers with different configurations and there is a unique script that launches all  local  scripts. Until now local scripts have never failed due it's simplicity, a bit more than:    git checkout master git pull git checkout pro git rebase master     (I've removed all non-GIT commands and the error checking)    but now all script have failed because there is a conflict between a change we have made in the main repository and a change that every local pro branch has (remember that the pro branch is not shared, just local to store some configuration).    Concretely, the problem has appeared when we have changed a couple of lines in a file called 'config.php' from this:    $db_user = 'user'; $db_password = 'password';     to this:    $db_user = 'other-user'; $db_password = 'other-password';     The conflict appears in the pro branch when the script executes the 'rebase' because the production server has a different value for these variables:    $db_user = 'pro-user'; $db_password = 'pro-password';     Of course the conflict is really easy to avoid  by hand  just ignoring the  new configuration  that comes from the repository (pro config shouldn't be changed).    The question is: how can I avoid this conflict? Because we don't want to resolve the conflict by hand on every ŝerver every time we find this kind of conflict. We can change the script without any problem if it's necessary, temporary or permanently to resolve the problem. ",["git","conflict"]]

Here is an example of the QueryOver call:    IList Event  s =     session.QueryOver Event (() =  @eventAlias)            .Fetch(@event =  @event.FiscalYear).Eager            .JoinQueryOver(() =  @eventAlias.FiscalYear, () =  fyAlias,  JoinType.InnerJoin, Restrictions.On(() =  fyAlias.Id).IsIn(_years))            .Where(() =  !@eventAlias.IsDeleted);            .OrderBy(() =  fyAlias.RefCode).Asc            .ThenBy(() =  @eventAlias.Name).Asc            .Skip(numberOfRecordsToSkip)            .Take(numberOfRecordsInPage)            .List();     How can I accomplish this?

["Parsing UDP packets from offline pcap file with Perl script"," I'm hoping someone can help me with the following issue.  I wrote a Perl script to parse all the UDP packets from an offline Pcap file and then write all the UDP data out to a file using Net::Pcap and NetPacket. It works fine on most of the pcap files.  I currently have a Pcap file where there are 4 extra bytes (Null/Loopback, Family: IP (2)) before the IP Header.  This is causing my script to check the protocol type using the wrong byte. I have looked all over and tried to offset the byte, but can't figure it out.  Is there some way to check for a null link type while in the loop(), remove the extra bytes and save it back to a pcap file.  I tried a number of ways, but each time it gets me only so far until I hit another problem.  I have seen some examples where a filter is set in the loop method, but that is only of live captures.  Any suggestions?

["Android Eclipse - Button that creates another button on click"," I'm trying to create an android app where users can divide up the courses they took in each year of college.

["Quotes Around JavaScript Arrays (Probably Very Easy Fix)"," I'm having a problem with quotes in my arrays, and it's probably a super easy fix, but I just can't figure out how on earth I'm supposed to fix it.     I'm using JQPlot to make charts of my social media information, as in Facebook likes, Twitter followers, etc. Initially when I load up the page I show everything from the past two weeks.     I then added two inputs for date, using CalenderDateSelect, a Prototype library. I use jQuery for everything else except for this, so all my jQuery selectors are:    j$('element').functon();     I bring in my original javascript arrays with the help of PHP. They look like the following:     script   likes=[    ?     $i = 0;     while($like = mysql_fetch_assoc($fb_data)) {         $d_day = date( d-M-y , $like['date']);         if ($i   0) {             echo ',';         }         echo  [' .$d_day. ',  .$like['likes']. ] ;         $i++;     }   ? ];   ? mysql_data_seek($fb_data, 0); ? //this resets $fb_data so I can use it again  dislikes=[    ?     $i = 0;     while($like = mysql_fetch_assoc($fb_data)) {         $d_day = date( d-M-y , $like['date']);         if ($i   0) {             echo ',';         }         echo  [' .$d_day. ',  .$like['dislikes']. ] ;         $i++;     }   ? ];   ? mysql_data_seek($fb_data, 0); ?   impressions=[    ?     $i = 0;     while($like = mysql_fetch_assoc($fb_data)) {         $d_day = date( d-M-y , $like['date']);         if ($i   0) {             echo ',';         }         echo  [' .$d_day. ',  .$like['impressions']. ] ;         $i++;     }   ? ];   /script      I then put them into a function:    socialMedia(likes, dislikes, impressions,false);     This function does the following (simplified for readability)     function socialMedia(likes, dislikes, impressions, bool) {  console.log(likes); console.log(dislikes); console.log(impressions);  var plot1 = j$.jqplot('chart1', [likes, dislikes, impressions], {     title:'Facebook Stats' });  if (bool) {     plot1.destroy();     j$.jqplot('chart1', [likes, dislikes, impressions], {     title:'Facebook Stats' }).replot(); }     }     The console log here makes the following (it's correct):    [[ 19-Nov-13 , 163], [ 20-Nov-13 , 163], [ 21-Nov-13 , 164], [ 22-Nov-13 , 165], [ 23-Nov-13 , 168], [ 24-Nov-13 , 181], [ 25-Nov-13 , 205], [ 26-Nov-13 , 226], [ 27-Nov-13 , 244], [ 28-Nov-13 , 250], [ 29-Nov-13 , 269], [ 30-Nov-13 , 306], [ 01-Dec-13 , 313], [ 02-Dec-13 , 315]]  [[ 19-Nov-13 , 0], [ 20-Nov-13 , 0], [ 21-Nov-13 , 0], [ 22-Nov-13 , 0], [ 23-Nov-13 , 1], [ 24-Nov-13 , 1], [ 25-Nov-13 , 0], [ 26-Nov-13 , 1], [ 27-Nov-13 , 0], [ 28-Nov-13 , 1], [ 29-Nov-13 , 0], [ 30-Nov-13 , 0], [ 01-Dec-13 , 0], [ 02-Dec-13 , 0]]  [[ 19-Nov-13 , 68], [ 20-Nov-13 , 116], [ 21-Nov-13 , 63], [ 22-Nov-13 , 15896], [ 23-Nov-13 , 79617], [ 24-Nov-13 , 42948], [ 25-Nov-13 , 22290], [ 26-Nov-13 , 1369], [ 27-Nov-13 , 928], [ 28-Nov-13 , 921], [ 29-Nov-13 , 631], [ 30-Nov-13 , 700], [ 01-Dec-13 , 743], [ 02-Dec-13 , 300]]     Note the quotes around the day-month-year.    So far everything works correctly.    I then go and change the end-date (e) and start-date (s) inputs and call this function when I do so:    function getNewSocialData(e, s) {     j$.ajax({          type: 'GET',          url: 'ajax/social_media.php?e='+e+'&amp;s='+s,          success:function(json){              data = json;             data = json.split( T );              socialMedia(data[0],data[1],data[2],true);          },          error: function (xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError) {             alert('There appears to be a problem with the information you submitted. Please try again or contact us.');           }     }); }     In social_media.php I do the following:    $end_date = date( Y-m-d 00:00 , strtotime($_GET['e'])); $start_date = date( Y-m-d 00:00 , strtotime($_GET['s']));  $fb_data = getFacebookData(strtotime($start_date), strtotime($end_date));  $inside_likes = array(); $inside_dislikes = array(); $inside_impressions = array();  $i = 0; while($like = mysql_fetch_assoc($fb_data)) {     $d_day = date( d-M-y , $like['date']);      $string = $i != 0 ?

This time my data is all like the following:     20-Nov-13 ,163, 21-Nov-13 ,164, 22-Nov-13 ,165, 23-Nov-13 ,168, 24-Nov-13 ,181, 25-Nov-13 ,205, 26-Nov-13 ,226, 27-Nov-13 ,244, 28-Nov-13 ,250, 29-Nov-13 ,269, 30-Nov-13 ,306, 01-Dec-13 ,313, 02-Dec-13 ,315   20-Nov-13 ,0, 21-Nov-13 ,0, 22-Nov-13 ,0, 23-Nov-13 ,1, 24-Nov-13 ,1, 25-Nov-13 ,0, 26-Nov-13 ,1, 27-Nov-13 ,0, 28-Nov-13 ,1, 29-Nov-13 ,0, 30-Nov-13 ,0, 01-Dec-13 ,0, 02-Dec-13 ,0   20-Nov-13 ,116, 21-Nov-13 ,63, 22-Nov-13 ,15896, 23-Nov-13 ,79617, 24-Nov-13 ,42948, 25-Nov-13 ,22290, 26-Nov-13 ,1369, 27-Nov-13 ,928, 28-Nov-13 ,921, 29-Nov-13 ,631, 30-Nov-13 ,700, 01-Dec-13 ,743, 02-Dec-13 ,300     And, as you can see, these are not arrays, they're strings, so JQPlot throws the error  uncaught exception: No Data . We then modify the success condition to put them into arrays:    success:function(json){     var likes = [];     var dislikes = [];     var impressions = [];     var followers = [];     var following = [];     var tweets = [];  data = json; data = json.split( T );  likes.push(data[0]); dislikes.push(data[1]); impressions.push(data[2]); followers.push(data[3]); following.push(data[4]); tweets.push(data[5]);  socialMedia(likes,dislikes,impressions,true);     }....     And it console's the following:    [  20-Nov-13 ,163, 21-Nov...13 ,313, 02-Dec-13 ,315 ] [  20-Nov-13 ,0, 21-Nov-1...Dec-13 ,0, 02-Dec-13 ,0 ] [  20-Nov-13 ,116, 21-Nov...13 ,743, 02-Dec-13 ,300 ]     Which has all of my data there, but inside quotes, causing JQPlot to being unable to parse it, and defaults my chart down to December 31st, 1969.     So, my questions: How do I push in the data in such a way so that the quotes don't go around it? I feel I may have a string and an array mixed up here somehow. Can somebody point me in the right direction?    Thanks a million!    EDIT:    Thank you everyone for your help. I'm getting closer. I changed my PHP to run like so:    while($like = mysql_fetch_assoc($fb_data)) { $d_day = date( d-M-y , $like['date']);  $inside_likes[] = array(' '.$d_day.' ,'.$like['likes']); $inside_dislikes[] = array(' '.$d_day.' ,'.$like['dislikes']); $inside_impressions[] = array(' '.$d_day.' ,'.$like['impressions']); }     $data['likes'] = $inside_likes; $data['dislikes'] = $inside_dislikes; $data['impressions'] = $inside_impressions;  echo json_encode($data); exit;     And my AJAX call now does the following:    j$.ajax({          type: 'GET',          url: 'ajax/social_media.php?e='+e+'&amp;s='+s,      dataType :  json ,          success:function(json){             var likes = json['likes'];             var dislikes = json['dislikes'];             var impressions = json['impressions'];      socialMedia(likes, dislikes, impressions, true);          },         ...     });     But now, when I console.log it, I'm getting this, note the double quotes.    [[  19-Nov-13 ,163 ], [  20-Nov-13 ,163 ], [  21-Nov-13 ,164 ], [  22-Nov-13 ,165 ], [  23-Nov-13 ,168 ], [  24-Nov-13 ,181 ], [  25-Nov-13 ,205 ], [  26-Nov-13 ,226 ], [  27-Nov-13 ,244 ], [  28-Nov-13 ,250 ], [  29-Nov-13 ,269 ], [  30-Nov-13 ,306 ], [  01-Dec-13 ,313 ], [  02-Dec-13 ,315 ]]     When I should be getting this:    [[ 19-Nov-13 , 163], [ 20-Nov-13 , 163], [ 21-Nov-13 , 164], [ 22-Nov-13 , 165], [ 23-Nov-13 , 168], [ 24-Nov-13 , 181], [ 25-Nov-13 , 205], [ 26-Nov-13 , 226], [ 27-Nov-13 , 244], [ 28-Nov-13 , 250], [ 29-Nov-13 , 269], [ 30-Nov-13 , 306], [ 01-Dec-13 , 313], [ 02-Dec-13 , 315]]     Does anybody have any suggestions? Thank you!    SOLUTION:    With help from below, the answer to get the arrays in the string and integer format was to do the following:    while($like = mysql_fetch_assoc($fb_data)) { $d_day = date( d-M-y , $like['date']);  $inside_likes[] = array($d_day, intval($like['likes'])); $inside_dislikes[] = array($d_day, intval($like['dislikes'])); $inside_impressions[] = array($d_day, intval($like['impressions'])); }     $data['likes'] = $inside_likes; $data['dislikes'] = $inside_dislikes; $data['impressions'] = $inside_impressions;  echo json_encode($data);  ",["javascript","jquery","arrays","jquery-ajax","jqplot"]]

["Keydown producing unexpected result. HTML5 Game"," So I am at the very beginning stages of creating my first platform style game in html5.So far I have only implemented left and right movement and no 'gravity' or collision detection is at play.    However, I've already hit an issue.    If you go left or right for a short period of time the 'character' acts as intended (I use character loosely as it's the map that is actually moving). If, however, you hold the key down the map moves too fast.    I figure the issue is that the keydown event listener is listening all of the time, there for moving the map is moving before each tick or frame of the game.     So my question is how can I make the keydown increase the map offset only on every tick of the game (20 milliseconds).    Here is my JSFiddle: CLICK HERE    document.addEventListener('keydown',function(event){     var dir = event.which;      if(dir == directions.LEFT){         mapOffsetX += mapOffsetDistanceX;         event.preventDefault();     };      if(dir == directions.RIGHT){         mapOffsetX -= mapOffsetDistanceX;         event.preventDefault();     }; });  document.addEventListener('keyup',function(event){     var dir = event.which;      if(dir == directions.LEFT){         mapOffsetX -= mapOffsetDistanceX;     };      if(dir == directions.RIGHT){         mapOffsetX += mapOffsetDistanceX;     }; });  initFloorObject(100,c.height/2,300,20,0,0,0,1);  var myInt = setInterval(function(){  clearScreen();  for(var i=0;i floorObject.length;i++){     floorObject[i][0] = parseInt(floorObject[i][0])+mapOffsetX; };  drawChar(); drawFloorObjects();  },20);  ",["javascript","html5","setinterval","keydown"]]

["How do I avoid looping through an image pixel by pixel with python (opencv & numpy)"," I'm looping through this image pixel by pixel and it's really slow. I have the 2 images I'm comparing sliced and flattened so each element is a 3 dimensional rgb value named e1 and e2. It is very slow though. Is there some method using opencv or numpy that can speed this up?       What I'm doing here is performing pixel comparisons on images with binned colors(8 colors). I'm reading from a jpeg though so what should be [255,0,0] becomes [230,12,11] so what clean_key does is threshold the values to the cleaner ones. Then I append the number of times this combination occurs to a dictionary. So for example dict[ 255,0,0 0,0,255 ] might occur 300 times in this image which means there were 300 instances where img1 had a red pixel and im2 had a blue pixel.    for e1,e2 in itertools.izip(im1_slice.reshape(-1,3),im2_slice.reshape(-1,3)):       key = str(clean_key(e1_row)) + str(clean_key(e2_row))       if key in proportion_dict:         proportion_dict[key] += 1       else:         proportion_dict[key] = 1             return (proportion_dict,total)  ",["python","opencv","numpy"]]

["Reverse the \"heat\" order for one of five columns in R function heatmap()"," This is my first post on stackoverflow.  I usually am able to find the answer to any question fairly quickly.  This search, however, is proving more difficult.  I apologize in advance if this is a duplicate question.    Firstly, I am using package RSQLite to call data from different tables in the lahman MLB  database.  After that, I do some further processing in R.  Here's my query.    mlb2010 = dbGetQuery(bb, 'SELECT Teams.teamID AS team, SUM(salary) AS pay,                                  W AS w, ROUND(CAST(H AS DOUBLE) / CAST(AB AS DOUBLE), 3) AS avg,                                 HR AS hr, ERA AS era,                           CASE WHEN WSWin =  Y  THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS ws                           FROM Salaries, Teams                           WHERE salaries.yearID = 2010                           AND teams.yearID = 2010                           AND teams.teamID = salaries.teamID                           GROUP BY teams.teamID;')     I then used heatmap in R to plot the leader for each of the respective performance categories.  My problem is that I need to reverse the  heat  of the column  era  because the best ERA is the lowest, not the highest.  Here's the code for the heatmap.    mlb10 = sapply(2:length(mlb2010), function(x) {   mlb2010[, x] = as.numeric(mlb2010[, x])    })  rc = rainbow(nrow(mlb10), start = 0, end = .3) cc = rainbow(ncol(mlb10), start = 0, end = .3)  heatmap(mlb10, col = rev(heat.colors(256)), scale =  column ,          Rowv = NULL, Colv = NA, RowSideColors = rc, ColSideColors = cc,          margins = c(5,10), labRow = c(mlb2010$team), labCol = names(al2010)[-1],         xlab =  Performance factors , ylab =   Team ,         main = c( Relating Performance to Payroll ,  2010 MLB Season ))      I have tried the revC argument in heatmap with no success.  Is that what I should be using?  Or does that reorder all of the columns, and not what is inside the column?  I've also tried an sapply over the colors to no avail.    Any help would be greatly appreciated.   ",["r","heatmap","rsqlite"]]

["VisualVM over Putty SSH-tunnel"," I'm trying to profile remote java app, actually it is a gameserver. It works normally on my local machine (windows XP x64 with JDK1.7.0_02 x64), but behaves very wierd on the production server (CentOS with JDK1.7.0_03 i586).    I've done a lot of searching and found out that I should use VisualVM for this task. So VisualVM works great on local machine, but there is no hangs on local machine, i need profiling in production environment with real payload.

["\"Couldn’t install on USB storage or SD card\" error installing application on Samsung devices"," The issue is that I started getting complains from my application's users that they failed to install our client on their devices.    Most of the devices are all kind of Samsungs with OS 2.2 and 2.3    The error they see after the install process is done (or almost done) is:  Couldn’t install on USB storage or SD card     I already checked and verified that there is enough space to install the application on those devices.    Naturally, I tried to remove the SD card abilities (removed the line  android:installLocation= preferExternal   from the AndroidManifest.xml file, but this change caused all the problematic devices to restart themselves after installation is done (device simply restarts when installation is about to be finished).    Needless to say, I can't debug it since our application's code did not start running yet.    I found some posts on this issue: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=9593 http://technology-headlines.com/2011/05/12/installation-error-%E2%80%9Ccouldnt-install-on-usb-storage-or-sd-card%E2%80%9D-solution-for-android/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/04/19/fixing-the-couldnt-install-on-usb-storage-or-sd-card-problem-on-android/    All are instructions for the user to remove the  /mnt/secure/asec/smdl2tmp1.asec  file. This works for most of the problematic devices, but I can't expect my users to go and delete temp files in this manner, they will probably just give up.    Another important point is that I went back to my historical versions and found out that old versions (released more than 8 months ago) works fine on those devices, but those versions are not supporting SD card installation and the gap between them and the current code base is so huge that making diffs and analyzing the changes in elimination process will take forever.    I would be happy to receive any tips on this issue    Thanks in Advanced for any assistance. ",["android","installation","sd-card"]]

["Linux driver development: how to investigate copy_to_user() timing?"," I'm developing a Linux driver and have found in some circumstances copy_to_user() takes much longer than expected.  I guess it may be waiting on the mm- mmap_sem semaphore, perhaps?  There also seems to be extra CPU activity in the unfavorable cases.    I would be grateful for advice on how to investigate this further and/or what to do about it.    More detail:    The platform has an I7 with 2 physical cores running at 2.5GHz, with a 32-bit X86 build of Linux 2.6.32.  The driver accepts data over PCI Express and supplies it to user space through a character device.  A test process runs at a high priority, reading into a buffer that I think is paged in.  The goal is to support quite high data rates, currently a few hundred megabits per second and ultimately about 1Gbps, sustained for at least a few seconds.    My test involves reading 25MB of data in a second or so.  With the right data set, the driver can receive reliably at 100Mbps or 400Mbps.  With slightly different 100Mbps data, it sporadically fails.  Neither the driver nor the test tool cares about the content of the data, so I would expect it to make no difference.  There may be statistical differences in arrival times and burstiness, but nothing large enough to stand out when reading through lists of timestamps.    The immediate cause of the problem is overflowing the receive buffer (about 1MB).  This is due to the process reading too slowly, which in turn is the result of copy_to_user() taking a long time.  A copy typically transfers a few hundred bytes.  With the good 100Mbps input this function returns reasonably quickly, usually well under a microsecond judging by the cycle count.  With the problematic 100Mbps data, some calls take as long as 10 milliseconds, and this can happen multiple times, not just a one-off.    The I7Z tool (link here) indicates a difference in CPU activity.  When processing the good 100Mbps data, one core spends most of its time in power state C1 and the other is mainly in C6 (low power).  With the bad data, one core is mainly in C0 (the most active state), the other may spend anything from 0 to 70% of its time in C1 and the rest mostly in C6.  So it looks like it's doing the normal processing plus a lot of extra C0.  Maybe a lot of spinning?    Pseudocode summary of the relevant parts of the driver and test tool:    pseudo_interrupt_handler() {         if(DMA finished) {                 advance head;                 wake_up_interruptible();         }         if(new data &amp;&amp; no DMA in progress) {                 start DMA into head;         } }  pseudo_file_read(filp, user buf, size) {         wait_event_interruptible(head != tail);          while(head != tail &amp;&amp; space in user buf) {                 copy_to_user(from tail);                 advance tail;         }         return total copied; }  pseudo_test_process() {         buffer = malloc(25MB);         write to each page in buffer; // page in          while(buffer not full) {                 read(STDIN_FILENO, position in buffer, 4000B);                 advance position in buffer         } }     I have no satisfactory workaround at present.

["Is this explicit template function specialization of a member template of a member template of a class template valid?"," Does anyone know if this explicit specialization is or is not valid:    template  class  struct L {   template  typename T    struct O {     template  typename U      static void Fun(U);   }; };  template   template typename T  template typename U  void L int ::O T ::Fun(U) {}     clang trunk (12/3/2013) gives the following error:  f:...\\test.cpp:36:20: error: out-of-line definition of 'Fun' from class 'O' without definition    void L int ::O T ::Fun(U) {}      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^     1 error generated.    Any supporting references from the standard to justify your answer will be greatly appreciated!    Note: I am somewhat surprised that it is an error - I would expect the specialization to be picked for any family of template arguments with which 'Fun' is instantiated beginning with  int  ?any  ?any .    Is this a clang bug or a bug in my expectations?    Thank you!     ====== EDIT (I think I have an answer) ========    OK - i think i found the supporting wording - from N3797 (post-chicago 2013 working draft) - 14.7.3/16 =         In an explicit specialization declaration for a member of a class template or a member template that appears in namespace scope, the member template and some of its enclosing class templates may remain unspecialized, except that the declaration shall not explicitly specialize a class member template if its enclosing class templates are not explicitly specialized as well.      If i interpret this correctly, we need an explicit specialization of O if we're going to declare an explicit specialization of its member? Hence the error.    Correct?    Thanks!

IDEAL:  What I want is to get reports seperated for each site (shop-site as well as information-sites), but add some conversion tracking. Ideal would be to be able to track a conversion when the user gets to the checkout process, so that I can see it in the statistics of the shop-site as well as on the site that referred to this sale/conversion and maybe even a funnel visualisation for the whole action.    WHAT I ALREADY GOT: I already set up statistics for each site/domain. I do have set events for a referal to the shop-site as well as an event when the user checks out.     WHAT I TRIED:  I set up cross domain tracking for one of my information-sites and the shop-site, so now the events show up in that single property.

I am proficient in Python and Javascript. I've used webdriver in the past for small scraping projects, but it was long ago enough that there's probably a similar overhead in re-learning it vs learning phantomjs.    I am not planning to run any kind of high-volume cluster-based scraping operation, this is all going to be running on my local machine at some appropriate rate limit so as not to piss off linkedin. It's mostly just for personal convenience, automation, etc.    I've heard good things about phantomjs, but I'd like to understand what if any advantage it has over webdriver (or vice versa). I guess phantomjs is  headless , meaning it doesn't actually have to run a browser, which I guess makes it easier to write command line scripts or consume fewer resources or some other property that I would love to have explained to me!    I can appreciate the argument that webscraping programs should be javascript, since that's more of a browser-native language, but would love to hear if that's a primary reason why people are using phantomjs (or one of its cousins)  ",["selenium","webdriver","web-scraping","phantomjs"]]

["DirectX SDK vs Windows SDK: which one to use?"," I have an old game engine (sort of) based on DirectX 10, which I've been planning to move to DX 11. I have also just installed Windows 8 and VS 2013 and, while trying to run this old project I've learnt that DirectX SDK has been deprecated and now replaced by Windows 8 SDK. In this case I wonder whether it makes sense to update to DX 11 or should I try and make my engine use the new Windows 8 SDK. There are several things I'd like to know before I make the decision:    1) Is Windows 8 SDK the thing to learn now or is DX 11 still relevant? Like, if you want to learn C++ you should learn C++11, so if you want to learn Direct3D now, you should learn Windows 8 SDK?    2) There are plenty of great resources for learning DirectX SDK: a lot of tutorials, Microsoft's own samples, NVidia Graphics SDK samples, AMD Radeon SDK samples etc. Are there any similar quality materials available for Windows 8's Direct3D or just msdn at the moment?    3) Will my Windows 8 SDK based engine run only on Windows 8?    4) Any first hand experience / comparisons between the two?    Many thanks! ",["c++","windows-8","directx"]]
["Query WMI from Go"," I would like to run WMI queries from Go. There are ways to call DLL functions from Go. My understanding is that there must be some DLL somewhere which, with the correct call, will return some data I can parse and use. I'd prefer to avoid calling into C or C++, especially since I would guess those are wrappers over the Windows API itself.    I've examined the output of dumpbin.exe /exports c:\\windows\\system32\\wmi.dll, and the following entry looks promising:    WmiQueryAllDataA (forwarded to wmiclnt.WmiQueryAllDataA)    However I'm not sure what to do from here. What arguments does this function take? What does it return? Searching for WmiQueryAllDataA is not helpful. And that name only appears in a comment of c:\\program files (x86)\\windows kits\\8.1\\include\\shared\\wmistr.h, but with no function signature.    Are there better methods? Is there another DLL? Am I missing something? Should I just use a C wrapper?    Running a WMI query in Linqpad with .NET Reflector shows the use of WmiNetUtilsHelper:ExecQueryWmi (and a _f version), but neither have a viewable implementation. ",["dll","go","wmi"]]
["Making use of idle cores in a parallel pipeline?"," I've been going through this tutorial on parallel pipelines and noticed that, while there is definitely a considerable difference in throughput, couldn't it be even better if the compression stage also took on a read job since it's just waiting around anyway? The same thing goes for the write stage... I mean, why not take on a third compression and then switch over to writing two, and then have one of those cores go back to compressing while the other wraps up the third write, and so on?    I apologize if this is obvious. I imagine this is standard practice and is called something, I'm just not sure what. Is their any overhead involved with switching jobs like this?    And I know this might be the wrong forum for this last question, but can the GPU switch jobs like this or should the programmable shaders/CUDA cores pretty much be left alone after being programmed?    EDIT: I guess I also don't understand how taking the same six-cores used in the 2 cores/stage example would be faster than just giving each of the six cores all three stages. Sure, there would be two cores that would do two, but that's still faster than the top scenario. I would understand it better in the GPU's case since there is specialized hardware involved for certain computations, but generally speaking, I don't see it. Maybe this example is weak or something because I know the parallel processing is here to stay.    ",["parallel-processing","pipeline"]]

["for-loop incorrectly outputs exponents"," I'm having a lot of trouble with this code. The assignment is:         You are to write a program that will process employees and their pay.  For each employee the program will read in an employee’s name and hourly pay rate.  It should also read in the number of hours worked each day for 5 days and calculate his or her total number of hours worked.  You must read the hours using a loop.  The program should output the employee’s name, gross pay, total withholding amount and net pay.     Withholding is made up of state tax, federal tax, and FICA.  For the purposes of this program the state tax will be 1.25% of the gross pay.  FICA will be 7.65% of the gross pay.  Federal tax will be 15% of the gross pay if the gross pay is under $500 and 25% otherwise.    You do not know how many employees there are but there will be a sentinel for the employee names.  The sentinel is “done”      The code compiles however the outputs are always large exponents.

["How to get the cursor in an UITextView to reflect an updated typingAttributes for paragraph alignment?"," I am using a UITextView to enter some rich text.  I have created a button to change the paragraph alignment (left, center, right).    I am applying the alignment to the attributedText when the user selects some text and it works as expected.    However, when the user hit return and is in a new, zero-length paragraph (just after a newline and nothing following), I believe I should change the typingAttributes to reflect the attributes I want the new text to receive.    I used the following code:    if ((paragraphRange.length == 0) &amp;&amp; (paragraphRange.location == [mutableText length])) {      NSMutableParagraphStyle * mutableParagraphStyle = [[NSParagraphStyle defaultParagraphStyle] mutableCopy];      [mutableParagraphStyle setAlignment:textAlignment];     [mutableParagraphStyle setLineBreakMode:NSLineBreakByWordWrapping];      NSMutableDictionary * attributes = [self.typingAttributes mutableCopy];     [attributes setObject:mutableParagraphStyle forKey:NSParagraphStyleAttributeName];     self.typingAttributes = attributes;     It does apply the paragraph alignment once the character is typed, but the cursor in the UITextView does not reflect the change until after the character is typed.  I am looking for a mechanism to get the cursor into the right place before the text is typed.  For example, if the user selects 'centered', I want the cursor to move to the center of the view to show where the text will do.      Anyone have any ideas on how to do this?

["Simple Socket Listener and Threads Memory Leak"," I have a simple C program that's supposed to listen for connections and start a new thread for each client that connects. The thread simply prints what messages it receives (for now). I followed two tutorials while making this.    It works, but I tried connecting and disconnecting repeatedly with netcat without sending any messages. Each time I connect, the program takes 8KB of memory, but it only releases 4KB when I disconnect. But I can't find the cause of the leak. It ends the thread and closes the socket every time the user disconnects.

["Update the next data"," Hello guys and good morning ...    I have a question here. Below is my input data which is in the form of text file. My problem here is, how I can  update  my code for instance, let say the input data below is  input1 . When I insert the data in the code below, it should give a new result, which will reduce the number of first and second value. I want it to run in looping form. I've tried put it in the for loop form, but it seems not update the new result.     For instance, in the first looping, I key in    C.txt   and the new data is  C1.txt  and I type in Y (which means I want to repeat the process), then I retype again  C1.txt (which now be my first data) and the new data is   C2.txt     the first value and the second value are changed but, the data below, is not changes. The C2 should update according to the C1 but now the problem is, it keeps using the C .     Can anyone help me to figure it why and how I can solve this problem?

["Does sqlite3 compress data?"," I've got an 7.4Gb csv file. After converting it to a sqlite database with a python script the output DB is 4.7Gb, around 60% of the original size.    The csv has around 150,000,000 rows. It has header:    tkey,ipaddr,healthtime,numconnections,policystatus,activityflag     And each row looks something like     261846,172.10.28.15,2012-02-03 16:15:00,22,1,1     The script uses healthtime to split the data into tables 192 tables    When I first saw these numbers, I assumed I had made an error someplace. How big of a reduction in file size should I expect from the added efficiency of only writing the healthtime 192 times instead of 150,000,000 times?    EDIT: As soon as I posted this I realized the answer. I'm removing about 40% of the string, hence the 40% reduction in size.     Edit 2 Let's calculate the difference in size between the plain text:     261846,172.10.28.15,2012-02-03 16:15:00,22,1,1       And the data base entry:    db(261846,'172.10.28.15',22,1,1)     First of all, we drop from 46 to 26 characters in plain text representation.     The remaining characters are:     261846,172.10.28.15,22,1,1      or 26 bytes. If each integer needs to be stored in 32 bit (4 bytes), then we have:    12 bytes (ipaddr) + 4 bytes * 4 (integer fields) = 28 bytes.    So it looks like converting to integers makes the storage slightly less efficient, and all of my gains come form reducing the number of characters stored in each row. ",["python","sqlite"]]

My previous pom.xml used the following:     plugin     groupId org.codehaus.mojo /groupId     artifactId osxappbundle-maven-plugin /artifactId     version 1.0-alpha-2 /version     configuration       mainClass ${mainClass} /mainClass       dictionaryFile ${basedir}/src/main/resources/Info.plist /dictionaryFile       iconFile ${basedir}/src/main/resources/timelord.icns /iconFile       javaApplicationStub ${basedir}/src/main/resources/JavaApplicationStub /javaApplicationStub       jvmVersion 1.5+ /jvmVersion     /configuration     executions       execution         phase package /phase         goals           goal bundle /goal         /goals       /execution     /executions   /plugin      I think I need to do something like this - but not sure the format.  How should this be formatted?  Or is there a Maven plugin already built that uses Oracle's Bundler?       plugin       artifactId maven-antrun-plugin /artifactId        version 1.3 /version        executions         execution           phase package /phase           configuration             tasks               bundleapp outputdirectory= dist                name= ${AppName}                displayname= ${AppDisplayName}                identifier= ${mainClass}                mainclassname= ${mainClass}                   runtime dir= ${env.JAVA_HOME}  /                 classpath file= NOT SURE HOW TO MAKE THIS  /               /bundleapp             /tasks           /configuration         /execution        /executions     /plugin   ",["maven","ant","app-bundle"]]

["Homogeneous values on levels in tree algorithm"," Consider a tree with 3 levels: L1, L2, L3 (but this is just a particular case, for question convenience; there is no limitation on the number of levels and children on each level).    Each level holds a key and a value (e.g. [string, integer]).    Algorithm: If the direct children all have the same value, then don't display those values on child level, but on parent level. Only leaves can have values, the parents just represent data depending on leaf content.    My solution: I changed my mind. I need a general solution, excluding the JFace LabelProviders. I traverse the tree in post-order, and keep values in a map. I would prefer to keep only entries that don't have a null value (i.e. level has something to display). Performance is critical.         Case 1           Case 2           Case 3 --------------   --------------   --------------   L1         | 1   L1         | -   L1         | -  |-- L2     | -   |-- L2     | 1   |-- L2     | - |   |-- L3 | -   |   |-- L3 | -   |   |-- L3 | 1 |   +-- L3 | -   |   +-- L3 | -   |   +-- L3 | 2 +-- L2     | -   +-- L2     | 2   +-- L2     | -     |-- L3 | -       |-- L3 | -       |-- L3 | 1     +-- L3 | -       +-- L3 | -       +-- L3 | 2      Limitation: I only have access to one level at a time, since I'm using content and label providers to fill in the tree. For example, I have a callback method called getColumnText(Object element, int columnsIndex), where element is an instance of L1/L2/L3, and columnIndex coincides with the value column.    My solution: Depending on what instance the element object is, I look up and/or down to see if the values conicide. If they do, I don't display the text on element level. The code is specific to my project, so I can't post any because it will make the question much harder. But if you reaaaaaallllllyyyy insist, I could write a pseudocode of it.     Question: I feel like this isn't very optimal (applying algorithm on each getColumnText call). Is there any chance of generalization of this algorithm? Or maybe should I move it outside the label provider and keep those 'values' in a map or such?  ",["java","algorithm","treeview","swt","jface"]]

["perl user input \"dynamic/auto-tab expansion\""," I have an idea for a little command-line tool that would hopefully let me navigate directories quicker and I need to know if given a character from   STDIN   it is possible, from within perl, to automatically inject characters into   STDIN   dependent on the context  (so it would look like an unsolicited tab-expansion if the circumstances are correct).    For example, supposing I had the following directories in some directory somewhere:     dir1 directory_2 test testing tested experiments     and contained in testing was the directories    fully_tested partially_tested      then invocation of the script would first list all directories cd-able from where I called and wait for input. If the first character I entered was a 't' I would like to automatically inject 'est' into STDIN (since  test  is in the union of test, testing, and tested), list all directories beginning with  test  and wait for further input.     if the next char was either 'e' or 'i' it would cd automatically into tested or testing respectively (since these directories are then uniquely determined), if it was some yet to be decided  easy to reach key  like * I would cd into test, hitting '.' would do a cd .., and hitting any other alphabetic character would have no effect (and perhaps some other easy to reach key might list everything).    Getting back to the example, typing the chars 'tef' means I would cd into testing/fully_tested (since 'te' uniquely matches testing and the 'f' uniquely matches fully_tested)    As for actually coding this up I would like it to be my own problem (I believe it is possible to process input on a char by char basis) so to reiterate, all I'm asking here is:     Does perl provide some mechanism via which STDIN can be modified without user interaction (such that I can emulate tab-expand on the commandline, but with this expansion happening behind the scenes)? Or in other words, on evaluation of the last input I want to silently do the tab expansion (with it  looking like a tab expansion  wrt to my input stream, as per the commandline) without explicitly hitting a   TAB       More detail: as far as I know what I am doing presently what I would end up with once coded up is something that would look like the following at runtime (suppose my home directory has the folders Desktop, Documents, Documents_bak, Downloads, Music)    Desktop/ Documents/ Documents_bak/ Downloads/ Music D Desktop/ Documents/ Documents_bak/ Downloads o Documents/ Documents_bak/ Downloads c Documents/ Documents_bak _ programming/ books/ ...(other directories)     which doesn't look very nice... What I would actually like is something that resembled    Desktop/ Documents/ Documents_bak/ Downloads/ Music D Desktop/ Documents/ Documents_bak/ Downloads Do Documents/ Documents_bak/ Downloads Documents Documents/ Documents_bak Documents_bak/ programming/ books/ ...(other directories) Documents_bak/     where the last line  Documents_bak/  is actually the input stream as though I had typed it all (so I could delete some of it if I wanted). It is only how to achieve this little bit that presents a problem to me    EDIT* I am not (as far as I'm aware) trying to reinvent the wheel here - I'm just trying to cut out the   TAB  ,   RET  , retype 'cd ' steps when changing directories. I.e. with my scheme it would take just  tef  to cd into testing/fully_tested yet just in bash I need  t  TAB  i  TAB    RET  cd  SPACE  f  TAB    RET    to do the same. ",["perl"]]

["homework and overloading in java"," Ok so this is my homework assignment, and I am having a heck of a time figuring out how to correctly use overloading to allow for a certain number of terms to print out.     Create a class that contains a method that accepts an integer from the user to display the next 5 terms in the following pattern: (n-7) * 3.    So, if the user enters 5, the output should be:    -6    -39    -138    -435    -1326    Add an overloaded method so the user can enter how many termss they want to print out in a pattern:    So, the user would enter 5 as the starting number and 3 as the number of terms to print out in the pattern.    The output would be:    -6    -39    -435    Add different method that displays the formula and provides calculation to the formula: (should get starting number from user input) and prints out the next 5 terms.    (5-7) * 3 = -6    (-6-7) * 3= -39    (-39-7) * 3 = -435    Add an overloaded method that displays the formula and the calculation to the formula and takes in how many times it should print: (should get from user input).     For example: User enters 5 as the starting number and print out 4 times.    (5-7) * 3 = -6    (-6-7) * 3= -39    (-39-7) * 3 = -435    (-435-7) * 3 = -1326    Specifics:    You have a separate class that contains all your methods. You should have 4 methods in this class. Your main should call these four methods getting user input where appropriate.       I'm not asking for anyone to do this for me, I just would appreciate a steer in the right direction. At the moment trying to collect the number of terms wanted by the user in the main class then pass it to the Numberpattern class and then from their have the program determine which Calc method to use is not working.

Before anyone says this, while I am attempting to load jquery in the footer, all other javascript will be loaded afterwards so it a question of jquery dependent scripts loading prior to the library.  Also, many of people will say that its not good to load core scripts in the footer which, from a best practices standpoint, may be true but this is irrelevant because Google wants it in the footer and that is all that really matters.  Any suggestions will be appreciated. ",["jquery","wordpress","load","footer"]]

["git pull merges no files if any of the deltas are conflicted (need manual merge)"," Please consider this scenario:     I made a change of X number of files, pushed into Gerrit   Joe makes a change of Y number of files, Z of which intersect with my change set   Joe's code review gets approved and gets merged into the remote branch, mine gets held in the code review stage   Because Joe and myself changed a Z number of files simultaneously and his changes got approved before mine, I have to merge my changes into the Z files that Joe changed also   I am in the same git branch I was in when I pushed into Gerrit and I have to be because that is the only branch that has my change ID which is the only link between git and Gerrit (to amend my existing Gerrit review, the amendment must be within the same commit, otherwise I would make a brand new branch and make everything easier but I can't do that because it doesn't have my change ID)   When I do a git pull in that same branch, the fetch part (remote- local) goes fine but the merge part (local branch- working dir) fails because of the Z files that require manual merging.  However, there are (Y minus Z) file changes that are not conflicted whatsoever.  WHY DIDN'T GIT MERGE THOSE FILES AS NO CONFLICT SHOULD BE STOPPING IT?   I do a manual merge of Z files but now the staged git change set lumps them together with the Y minus Z changes that I have nothing to do with and shows them as modified/deleted in git status.  They were modified/deleted on the remote, not local.  If I do a commit, they will be included in the commit whereas I only want to include the Z files in my commit.  So I can't really commit because if I do, all of the Y files will show and make it into the code review when they shouldn't, cluttering the code review.    Like I said in 5. above, I would resolve this contention by creating a brand new branch BUT I cannot do that because I won't have my change ID in that branch that I need to hook into the same existing Gerrit ticket.    The main two questions being:    Q1.  How/can you make git merge the unconflicted files in the merge stage of the git pull while leaving the conflicted ones to be resolved manually?  That way, once you are done doing the manual merge, you can do a build with the latest from the remote to make sure you can build before making any commits even locally.  It seems to me this is a fundamental flaw with git (unless I am doing something wrong, e.g. not using some option with my git pull)    Q2.  Is there a way to push into an existing Gerrit review (amend it) using a different commit/change-ID from the one that was used to create the review initially?  So far, the only answer I have been able to get to this question internally as well as on the internet is NO but to me that seems like another major deficiency.  Because that Gerrit constraint, as explained above, limits you from utilizing the strongest feature of git, which is making local branches (in which you don't have that change ID) easily.

UserControl x:Class= AwesomeControl      StackPanel Orientation= Vertical         TextBlock Text= {Binding Path=Val1}                 Style= {StaticResourse Yes}  /        Button Content= I'm Button 1              Command= {Binding Path=PathtoCommand1}              CommandParameter= {Binding Parameter1}              IsEnabled= {Binding IsEnabled1}  /        Button Content= I'm Button 2              Command= {Binding Path=PathtoCommand2}              CommandParameter= {Binding Parameter2}              IsEnabled= {Binding IsEnabled2}              Tag= {Binding Path= DataContext.TagItem2}            Button.ContextMenu            ContextMenu              MenuItem IsCheckable= True                       IsChecked= {Binding Path=Tag}                       DataContext= {Binding Path=PlacementTarget, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type ContextMenu}}}  /            /ContextMenu          /Button.ContextMenu        /Button     /StackPanel   /UserControl    UserControl x:Class= AwesomerControl      StackPanel Orientation= Vertical         TextBlock Text= {Binding Path=FancyName2}                 Style= {StaticResourse Yes}  /        Button Content= Clicker 1              Command= {Binding Path=DoSomethingGreat1}              CommandParameter= {Binding Greatness1}              IsEnabled= {Binding IsTurnedOn1}  /        Button Content= Clicker 2              Command= {Binding Path=DoSomethingGreat2}              CommandParameter= {Binding Greaterness2}              IsEnabled= {Binding IsTurnedOn2}              Tag= {Binding Path= DataContext.TagItem2}            Button.ContextMenu            ContextMenu              MenuItem IsCheckable= True                       IsChecked= {Binding Path=Tag}                       DataContext= {Binding Path=PlacementTarget, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type ContextMenu}}}  /            /ContextMenu          /Button.ContextMenu        /Button     /StackPanel   /UserControl      Here I set the UserControls to a specified DataTemplate. The UserControls were moved out to make the XAML easier to read/navigate. In actuality the UserControls are a few hundred lines each.     Window.Resources     DataTemplate x:Key Template1         customControls:AwesomeControl/     /DataTemplate    ...

TemplateN= {StaticResource TemplateN }  /Window.Resources      The ListBox is defined as this.     ListBox ItemSource= {Binding Path=CollectionofMyObjects}           ItemTemplateSelector= {StaticResource templateselector}  /      I am using a single ViewModel to drive the MainWindow and the UserControls.    So that's where I'm at, essentially. I have this currently working as I'd like, but in an ongoing effort to learn (this is my first MVVM/WPF/C# project) I'd like to keep exploring how to make my code  better  (however that's defined). I'm not looking to solve an error here. So to avoid a general/broad question, I'll ask what I think I want to know. Someone can correct me and I'll update the  question(s)  appropriately    Question: How can I go about producing a ViewModel for each of the UserControls? Some of the ViewModels, for the UserControls, will occasionally require two-way communication to the MainWindow_ViewModel.

["Match labels to arrows in Excel flowchart using VBA"," I'm writing a code generation tool using VBA in Excel (don't ask why—long story). I need to be able to  parse  a flowchart.    The problem is that Excel allows shapes to contain text, with the exception of connectors: lines and arrows can't contain text. To label an arrow, you just put a text box on top of it—but the box isn't  attached  to the arrow in a way that VBA can easily capture.    For example, a user might draw something like this:       Within my VBA code, I can use ActiveSheet.Shapes to find that the flowchart contains seven shapes: there are five boxes (the two labels are just boxes with no border) and two arrows. Then Shape.TextFrame2 will tell me what's written inside each box, and Shape.ConnectorFormat will tell me which box goes at the start and end of each arrow.    What I need is code that can deduce:     Label A belongs to the arrow from Box 1 to Box 2   Label B belongs to the arrow from Box 1 to Box 3    I can think of three ways of doing this, none of them satisfactory.      Ask the user to group each label with its corresponding arrow.     Find out the coordinates of the endpoints of each arrow, then calculate which arrows pass through which labels.     Find out the coordinates of the corners of each box, then calculate which labels lie between which pairs of boxes.     Method 1 makes things easier for the programmer but harder for the user. It opens up a lot of potential for user error.  I don't see this as an acceptable solution.    Method 2 would be reasonably easy to implement, except that I don't know how to find out the coordinates!    Method 3 is doable (Shape.Left etc will give the coordinates) but computationally quite messy. It also has potential for ambiguity (depending on placement, the same label may be associated with more than one arrow).    Note that methods 2 and 3 both involve trying to match every label with every arrow: the complexity is quadratic. Typical applications will have 10–50 arrows, so this approach is feasible, if somewhat inelegant.    Does anyone have a better idea? Ideally it would be something that doesn't involve coordinate geometry and complicated logic, and doesn't involve asking users to change the way they draw flowcharts.     Edited to add: example 2 in response to Tim Williams       Here's a label whose bounding box intersects the bounding box of both arrows, and whose midpoint isn't inside the bounding box of either arrow. Visually it's easy for a human to see that it belongs with the left arrow, but programmatically it's hard to deal with. If I can find out the coordinates of the arrows' endpoints, then I can calculate that one arrow passes through the label's box but the other doesn't.  But if all I have is the bounding rectangles of the arrows, then it doesn't work. ",["excel","vba","excel-vba","charts","arrow"]]

Taking the example of a video decoder H.264, it has a parser function as shown below:    static int h263_parse(AVCodecParserContext *s,                            AVCodecContext *avctx,                            const uint8_t **poutbuf, int *poutbuf_size,                            const uint8_t *buf, int buf_size) {     ParseContext *pc = s- priv_data;     int next;      if (s- flags &amp; PARSER_FLAG_COMPLETE_FRAMES) {         next = buf_size;     } else {         next= ff_h263_find_frame_end(pc, buf, buf_size);          if (ff_combine_frame(pc, next, &amp;buf, &amp;buf_size)   0) {             *poutbuf = NULL;             *poutbuf_size = 0;             return buf_size;         }     }      *poutbuf = buf;     *poutbuf_size = buf_size;     return next; }     Could anyone please explain, the parameters of the above function.    According to me:    poutbuf-  is a pointer that points to parsed frame data.  poutbuf_size-  contains the size of the data.     Are my above assumptions right? Which parameter holds the input buffer data? And what is the above parse function returning? Also a brief explanation for the above code will be anyone who is referring to the post. Any information regarding the same will be really helpful.     Thanks in advance.    -Regards ",["c","parsing","video","ffmpeg","codec"]]

["Browser won't show home page when running Tomcat in Eclipse for a simple Struts2/jdbc app"," I finished coding an app following a tutorial for a simple crud app using Struts2 and jdbc. Eclipse looks all green and is detecting no errors running Tomcat from my Eclipse Kepler IDE. I think it is just running Tomcat itself and not running the app through Tomcat. I looked at the add/remove submenu in the servers tab and it shows my current project as configured for Tomcat. However, it runs but does not pull up a browser page showing the localhost:8080 page with my index jsp. It does not show anything at all, the console just shows that Tomcat is running but no browser    I am not trying to run a single page, I am trying to run the entire program. Normally I just right click the project folder, click run as, and choose Tomcat server. It normally runs fine from there. However, this project doesn't give me an option to run Tomcat. I think it has to do with the fact that I imported this project into Eclipse as opposed to creating it from within Eclipse. My project has no visible connection to Tomcat except that in my servers tab, I clearly see that my project is configured for Tomcat.

["Status code, text and all response headers are null for an XHR that has status code > 400 in Firefox"," I'm trying to detect when an Ajax (xhr) request gets a status code of 408 in order to direct the user to a login/timeout page.    At the moment I'm using an old version of jQuery (1.3.2) to perform all of my ajax requests and have the following bit of code to detect 408 error responses:    $().ready(function() {   $.ajaxSetup({     error:function(x,e) {       if (x.status==408) {         document.location.href = '/timeout.html';        } else {         document.location.href = '/error.html';        }        }   }); });     This code is not working as intended in Firefox and the xhr object has a status code of 0 and empty status text even though the status code is indeed 408. As a result the general error page is loaded instead of the timeout page.     EDIT: I tried console.dir(x) and got this output (as you can see status is 0 and status text is   ):     The ajax request is not cross domain and is being made from the same domain.    I also noticed that all response headers are cleared for any XHR that has an error status in Firefox.     None of these issues are evident in Chrome.    I even tried a simple XMLHttpRequest to a URL that will return a 408 status (all on the same domain/origin) and all headers were null - example shown below:    var x = new XMLHttpRequest(); x.open( GET ,  http://example.com/url-that-will-return-408-status ); x.onreadystatechange = function() {   if(this.readyState == 2) {     console.log('CustomErrorCode=' + this.getResponseHeader('CustomErrorCode'));     console.log('Content-Length=' + this.getResponseHeader('Content-Length'));     console.log('Content-Type=' + this.getResponseHeader('Content-Type'));     console.log(this.getAllResponseHeaders());   } } x.send();     Any ideas as to why Firefox is different to Chrome in this regard and how I can work around this issue? Based on my reading of the W3C spec it seems that maybe Firefox is doing the right thing but I don't quite understand why response headers would be cleared for an error status.

["R - sequence alignment function taking too long to run"," So, I am fairly new to R and I have a runtime question. I wrote the following nested while-loop using the  Biostrings  package (biocLite) in order to link protein sequences from two species if they have a  90% alignment score.    Basically, I input two protein genomes, compare each amino acid sequence in SeqData1 to each amino acid sequence from SeqData2, compute an alignment score, and if the score is  90% I concatenate a list of the protein names that match and the sequence of the SeqData2 protein.

["JavaScript prototype vs. this in practice"," I've read many questions with valid and understandable answers here in Stack Overflow and other sites over the web, and I think I understand everything I need for using JavaScript to make object-oriented apps, save one thing: What is the real, practical purpose of using a class' prototype over this?     I've read that any method, even one set as a this member, will be called from the constructor (class) function, and not re-created for each instance.   I've seen many examples of using prototype for setting methods, implying that it would save memory by using the original class-function's method on the instance, and not a brand new attribute.    So, along with remarking which of the two options above is true, I'd like to know: is a prototype method accessing the constructor's this ( public ) variables or the instance's (which may have been set as different from the constructor's)?    Edit - is using this.prototype.method = function() inside the constructor's scope wrong? All examples I've seen set a prototype method after the function has been created. ",["javascript","oop"]]

It contains the text boxes and a submit button which calls the CreateData action in the controller.     div class= form-horizontal       @Html.ValidationSummary(true)      div class= form-group            input id= CreateData  type= submit  class= btn btn-primary  value= Create Data File  /       /div   /div      Controller.cs - Reads the data passed in and creates the XmlModel object that is serialized using helper class XmlResult.

Now we want some more inputs on the form and based on these inputs some more complex xml data needs to be generated in the same xml file.    The xml format is complex but it will be new data in the previous xml like:     ?xml version= 1.0  encoding= utf-16 ?   Data     RelationData       Relation Title= Friends          Persons           Person FirstName= Tom  LastName= B  /           Person FirstName= Jerry  LastName= C  /         /Persons       /Relation       Relation Title= Friends          Persons           Person FirstName= Hello  LastName= AD  /           Person FirstName= World  LastName= BC  /         /Persons       /Relation      ...    /RelationData     ComplexData     ...    /ComplexData   /Data      As you can see, the form can supply multiple Relation items as well as some ComplexData. I don't want to create classes for this ComplexData structure, so I probably want some way to directly write the xml instead of serializing the objects. Also tying the view to Relation model doesn't make sense now.    So how can I go about this, so that I am still able to generate the xml file in the browser? In the current solution, it is doing a server post but I am willing to change that to entirely work on the client side. Not sure if this can be done using jquery/javascript?

I tried calling unset($e) in the catch block, but it didn't help.    How do I reset (or destroy or clear or unset or get rid of) the exception after it has been caught and dealt with? Or is it the nature of PHP that these exception objects are global and can never be made to go away once they exist in the current scope/script/request?    UPDATE: This question is not valid.

["When I add floating to a set of divs, all divs overlap and jump to the same position"," I've been trying to practise building layouts for web pages and have run into a slight problem. When I try to float 1 or 2 div's, they all automatically jump to the same position and overlap. I'm sure I am missing something but I can't quite work out what it is.    Now I have 3 div's set up inside my main div for example inside  box1  I have  header ,  content  &amp;  footer .     div id= box1    div id- header        div id= logo   img src= logo.png /  /div       div id= apology  enter text here /div   /div   div id= content       enter content text  /div   div id= footer       footer  /div         Now... It is to my knowledge (I may most probably be wrong) that when you float an object it is relative to it's container?    The two div's I am trying to float are  logo  and  apology .  logo  to the left and  apology  to make the page responsive to the size of the browser window (as you've probably guessed)    As normal the boxes stack vertically one on top of the other but as soon as I add the float properties to #logo and #apology in my CSS file, every div seems to jump to the top of the browser and overlap.    I have considered adding margins and heights to the div's in my css to position the  content  and  footer  boxes to where I want them but had deleted those entries due to it making them both fixed to where I had set the margins so when I resized the browser as normal my two floating divs would meet and arrange themselves one under the other however they would then overlap the  content  again.    I'm at the point of pulling my hair out now so any help would be much appreciated, especially as I've managed to turn a simple question into an essay.

["Is the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane enough for CJK speakers?"," The Question:  Is supporting only the Unicode BMP sufficient to enable native Chinese / Japanese / Korean speakers to use an application in their native language?     I'm most concerned with Japanese speakers right now, but I'm also interested in the answer for Chinese people as well.  If an application only supported characters on the BMP - would it make the application unusable for Chinese/Japanese speakers (i.e. app did not allow data entry / display of supplemental characters)?    I'm not asking if the BMP is the only thing you would ever need for any kind of application (clearly not - especially for all language in the entire world).  I'm asking for CJK speakers, in a professional context, for a modern kind of ordinary app that deals with general free text entry (including, names, places, etc.) - is the BMP generally enough?      Even if only supporting the BMP is not correct - would it be pretty close /  good enough ? Would the lack of supplemental characters in an application only be an occasional minor inconvenience; or would a Japanese speaker, for example, consider the application completely broken?  Especially considering that they would always be able to work around the problem by spelling out problematic words with Hiragana/Katakana?      What about Chinese speakers who don't have a fallback option, would the lack of supplemental characters be considered a show-stopping problem?    I'm considering general professional context here - not social or gaming stuff.  As an example, there's a lot of the emoticons on the supplemental planes - but I personally would not consider an English app that did not support Unicode emoticon characters to be  broken , at least for most professional use.    The application I'm dealing with right now is written in Java, but I think this question applies more generally.  Knowing the answer will also help me (regardless of language) get a better handle on how much effort I'd have to go through with regard to font support. ",["unicode"]]

["Fast Fourier Transformation Algorithm/Library for Motion Data in Processing?"," I posted earlier about using Processing combined with the Leap Motion https://www.leapmotion.com/ in order to build an application that could detect hand tremor. I believe I will need to perform a FFT for this to work. Only one I know of in Rrocessing is Minim but that is for sound data. I am fairly ignorant on this topic as of now (I have been watching youtube tutorials explaining how FFTs work all day I swear I'll be dreaming about it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsMXQfnmOiQtonight) but from what I know so far I don't think Minim will work for my motion data.     Someone mentioned to me about Kiss FFT which is not audio-specific, but it's written in C which I would like to avoid at all cost lol (I'm already confused enough as it is).     Any pointer in the right direction will be great. I'm going to continue to lurk the Internets for more information on this topic in the meantime.    I also happen to come across this cool java demo that is doing what I want to do but except only in 2D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYAQYd5AxXw. I'm new to Processing but I know its java based and I've seen people use java libriees in processing apps so would it possible to use what ever algorithm/library that is shown in this video?

["C++ XOR encryption"," After reading several white papers on cryptography and runtime PE crypters, I decided to write my own. It's very simple and only for educational purposes.     Here is the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Jyang772/XOR_Crypter    I have three questions.     First, why do I have to keep changing my file permissions to start every outputted .exe?     Second, I keep getting the error message:     wchar_t *  is incompatible with parameter of type  LPCSTR     (I decided to build the solution with Unicode Set, and didn't think much of it)      Third, I can't seem to get XOR encryption to work. It seems pretty straight forward for what I have done. The byte sizes are the same. While I was investigating, I had the Builder and the Stub each output a file with the file data unencrypted. They are the same. Then I tried with the data encrypted. There is no doubt the data is encrypted with the cipher, however it shows up blank when it is decrypted by the stub later on. I'm confused.     Here is my XOR implementation:    fs = byte size Rsize = byte size Should be the same.    Builder:     char cipher[] = penguin ;       for (int i = 0; i   fs; i++)         {                    FB[i] ^= cipher[i % strlen(cipher)]; // Simple Xor chiper         }     Stub:    char cipher[] =  penguin ; for (int i = 0; i   Rsize; i++)     {         RData[i] ^= cipher[i % strlen(cipher)];     }     If I were to comment out the encryption function in the Builder and Stub, the crypted file runs fine. Uhh, except with the permissions error. ",["c++","encryption","cryptography"]]

From a doc I have, it is said that:        Standard C specifies that a switch can have at least 257 case   statements. Standard C++ recommends that at least 16,384 case   statements be supported!

["AS3 Removing Object from Stage"," Title is quite vague, sorry about that. Can't think of how to ask this question in one sentence.    I will summarize what my code should do:     Prompts user for a number between 1-99. This number is the number of mines that will appear on stage.   Once the mines appear on stage, the user can click any mine and an 'explosion' will occur.   The mine that just exploded will be removed from stage.   Then, the 'explosion' will set off the nearest two.   Those two mines will be removed from stage while two more mines are set off. (ie chain reaction)    I have steps 1-3. I am having trouble 'setting off' the nearest two mines (ie removing from stage).    I made it possible to determine the two closest mines from the last exploded one, but I can't seem to find a way on how to remove them.

["Infinite loop on one hand, NoSuchElementException on the other"," I recently asked if there is any possible way whatsoever to get an exception from assigning a value to a String variable with the Scanner (The thread is here:)    And one of the guys told me that CTRL+D would be a case where a NoSuchElementException could be thrown. This to me is kind of a special case because input.nextLine() returns a String, and a String can be basically anything a user could type on the keyboard, so one would assume that input.nextLine() would not be a concern to throw an exception.    So I decided to add some try catch blocks into a program I'm writing on the off chance that CTRL+D is pressed when the program is asking for a number.     The problem I've run into is that when I catch the CTRL+D exception, the Scanner needs to be flushed, but if I flush the Scanner, it will cause a NoSuchElementException to occur because no new line exists.

["SASS and simple Math (Addition) of two EM units"," For whatever reason, I can never get simple math functions straight in SASS. I have a situation where I want to add twice the gutter width to a width that I have already defined somewhere else.

Here are some things that I tried:     $width: 18.75em; /* 300px */ $grid-spacing: 2em;   .column { margin-right: $width + $grid-spacing*2; }     Results in .column { margin-right: 18.75em2em; }    .column { margin-right: $width + ($grid-spacing*2); }      Results in .column { margin-right: 18.75em2em; }    .column { margin-right: $width + #{$grid-spacing*2}; }      Results in .column { margin-right: 18.75em + 2em; }    .column { margin-right: #{$width + #{$grid-spacing*2} };      Results in .column { margin-right: 18.75em + 2em; }    .column { margin-right: #{$width} + #{$grid-spacing*2}; }     Results in .column { margin-right: 18.75em + 2em; }    So what am I missing here? According to an issue on the SASS Github, I shouldn't have to rely on clearing units from values before doing math with them. The problem, I think, is that the + operator is used for concatenation as well as math, and this might be why my values are being treated like strings and not numbers that can be added together.     Thoughts?  ",["css","sass","compass-css"]]

The relevant section of my _mapping for reference:    {      event : {          dynamic :  false ,          properties : {             target : {                  type :  string ,                  index :  not_analyzed ,                  store : true,                  omit_norms : true,                  index_options :  docs              }         }     } }     Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

["How can I write Rails routes to identify particular parameter"," I have a route like the following.    match  /shop/:city(/:filter1)(/:filter2)(/:filter3/)(:filter4)   =    shop#filter , :method =  :post, :as =  :shop_filter     What I need is after :city, it can be filter1, filter2 etc..

["Remove all files older than X days, but keep at least the Y youngest"," I have a script that removes DB dumps that are older than say X=21 days from a backup dir:    DB_DUMP_DIR=/var/backups/dbs RETENTION=$((21*24*60))  # 3 weeks  find ${DB_DUMP_DIR} -type f -mmin +${RETENTION} -delete     But if for whatever reason the DB dump jobs fails to complete for a while, all dumps will eventually be thrown away. So as a safeguard i want to keep at least the youngest Y=7 dumps, even it all or some of them are older than 21 days.    I look for something that is more elegant than this spaghetti:    DB_DUMP_DIR=/var/backups/dbs RETENTION=$((21*24*60))  # 3 weeks KEEP=7  find ${DB_DUMP_DIR} -type f -printf '%T@ %p\\n' | \\  # list all dumps with epoch sort -n | \\                                         # sort by epoch, oldest 1st head --lines=-${KEEP} |\\                            # Remove youngest/bottom 7 dumps while read date filename ; do                       # loop through the rest     find $filename -mmin +${RETENTION} -delete      # delete if older than 21 days done     (This snippet might have minor bugs - Ignore them. It's to illustrate what i can come up with myself, and why i don't like it)    Edit: The find option  -mtime  is one-off:  -mtime +21  means actually  at least 22 days old . That always confused me, so i use -mmin instead. Still one-off, but only a minute. ",["bash","shell","command-line","find"]]

["Re-attach controls to AVPlayerItem in ARC project"," I'm not sure if this is even possible, but I've modified purchased code to suit my needs but have become stuck.  It's a storyboard app that consists of a (root) View controller -  4 Nav Controllers Part 1 -  4 Nav controllers Part 2 =  Final View Controller.    Basically the different nav controllers choose radio genre, then you pick a station, which then pushes segue to the player view (final).    I've modified it thus far, to essentially skip the genre &amp; station selection so that when you press the button on the root controller, the player pops up and streams the the hard coded station.  This all works exactly as I want atm.    Where I am stuck is, when pressing the  Back  button, the view is dismissed and I return to the root.  The AVPlayerItem continues to play the music (intentional as I did not issue a  stop  prior to the dismissal.      I wrapped the  play  section with a is_playing boolean to that when the view was viewed again it did not create a second instance of the AVPlayerItem... The problem I have is that the Play/Pause &amp; Mute buttons no longer work.  My guess is that ARC has unattached them so to speak from the AVPlayerItem...    So how can I re-bind them?    I've added the .h and .m in code sections for the specific view so any help (even if it's correcting or improving my methods) would be greatly appreciated.

["How can I allow a user to access an on-the-fly webpage resource via a link?"," On websites like Amazon.com, a user can run a search and is taken to the web results page. The user can then click on a link and be taken to a specific resource page. In the URL, you can see something like  http://www.amazon.com/Razor-Scooter , indicating the scooter as the resource. It's even done on the Stack Overflow site, with this URL.    I have a website that so far allows a user to search for a resource in my database. (Specifically, they are searching for classes they can take at the university.) There are about 2000 classes, and obviously I don't want to create a webpage for each one separately. I'd like to have the user click the link and then go away from the current page to a basic html webpage template which fills with the information from the database.    I use AJAX right now for the search, and I know AJAX is for not having to switch pages. I use PHP to connect to my database. I know there's a way to use PHP to render the webpage, but is that how it is done in the Amazon.com example above? there's no  .php/  there. I want someone to be able to put in the course page they want directly like with  aaaaaaa.com/department-course  where they specify the department, course, and section.    So I guess my question is this: How do I make it so that I can show a user a new page of the requested database resource object without having it entirely pre-made?

["Fix spacing around an image using the .thumbnail class in Bootstrap?"," I am using bootstrap v2.3.1, and I am trying to understand how to fix one of my images.    In the example image link below, the top image is what I want all the images to look like when the screen is resized to it's smallest size (cellphone size), and the bottom image is what's giving me an issue:    http://i.imgur.com/BH02ONQ.jpg    For some reason it has more space on the sides of the 2nd image than it should have.    (NOTE: My screenshot is altered to show both the correct image and the wrong image. The code below is what I am actually using)    My code is this:     section       ul class= thumbnails            li               a class= thumbnail  rel= group  href= images/r1.jpg                    img src= images/thumbnails/r1s.jpg  alt=   /               /a           /li           li               a class= thumbnail  rel= group  href= images/r2.jpg                    img src= images/thumbnails/r2s.jpg  alt=   /               /a           /li       /ul   /section      So I don't know if it's an issue with one of the settings in the CSS file, but since I am using the .thumbnail class, I'm guessing it has to do with that?

["Community detection with InfoMap algorithm producing one massive module"," I am using the InfoMap algorithm in the igraph package to perform community detection on a directed and non-weighted graph (34943 vertices, 206366 edges). In the graph, vertices represent websites and edges represent the existence of a hyperlink between websites.    A problem I have encountered after running the algorithm is that the majority of vertices have a membership in a single massive community (32920 or 94%). The rest of the vertices are dispersed into hundreds of other tiny communities.    I have tried different settings with the nb.trials parameter (i.e. 50, 100, and now running 500). However, this doesn't seem to change the result much.    I am feeling rather exasperated because the run-time on the algorithm is quite high, so I have to wait each time for the results (with no luck yet!!).    Many thanks. ",["r","igraph","sna"]]

After this I created a small script to be able to login.     // Use this for initialization void Start () {     enabled = false;                       FB.Init(SetInit, OnHideUnity);   }  // Update is called once per frame void Update () {  }  private void SetInit()                                                                        {                                                                                                 FbDebug.Log( SetInit );                                                                       enabled = true; //  enabled  is a property inherited from MonoBehaviour                       if (FB.IsLoggedIn)                                                                            {                                                                                                 FbDebug.Log( Already logged in );                                                             OnLoggedIn();                                                                             }                                                                                         }                                                                                              private void OnHideUnity(bool isGameShown)                                                    {                                                                                                 FbDebug.Log( OnHideUnity );                                                                   if (!isGameShown)                                                                             {                                                                                                 // pause the game - we will need to hide                                                      Time.timeScale = 0;                                                                       }                                                                                             else                                                                                          {                                                                                                 // start the game back up - we're getting focus again                                         Time.timeScale = 1;                                                                       }                                                                                         }      void OnGUI(){     if (!FB.IsLoggedIn)                                                                                                   {                                                                                                                                  if (GUI.Button(new Rect(179 , 11, 287, 160),  Login to Facebook ))                                               {                                                                                                                         FB.Login( email , LoginCallback);                                                                 }                                                                                                                 }     }  void LoginCallback(FBResult result)                                                         {                                                                                               FbDebug.Log( LoginCallback );                                                               Debug.Log( LoginCallback );     if (FB.IsLoggedIn)                                                                          {                                                                                               OnLoggedIn();                                                                           }                                                                                       }                                                                                            void OnLoggedIn()                                                                           {                                                                                               FbDebug.Log( Logged in.

Can anybody help why is this?  Another strange thing I observed that the LoginCallback gets called as soon as I click on the login button, even though I would think it should only when I gave permission. Anyway when I give permission it returns to my app and nothing happens. I can click on the login button again and same thing happens, login callback called, it asks for permisions, I give the permision and returns back, nothing happened. Can anybody help?

["create excel grid populated with data via PHP / Mysql"," I am trying to use PHP to pull information out of a mysql database and then populate it into a excel file in a grid like format which is seen in the attached excel file. Basically my issue is as you can see the php code is working that takes the id numbers and customers name out of the database it also for the current days date pulls the correct amounts. However none of the other dates work and I believe there is an error in my code as you can see in the screenshot the 2nd row I am echoing out the date which is used to query the database . However for what ever reason it is one day off. So I think that might be the issue.    I have tried to trouble shoot best I can with trying different ways to generate the date columns and and think the way my code is doing it which I know some may say is sloppy decent. I am hoping someone can take a look at my code and see where my error is which is causing the dates that are used to actually make the database calls are skipping every other day.

["Get E 164 format of contacts in Android API less than 16"," I retrieve the list of contact numbers from the phone using the following code:      Cursor c = getContentResolver().query(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null);  while(c.moveToNext()){       Log.d(TAG, NO.:  + c.getString(c.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.NORMALIZED_NUMBER))); }     In API 16 and above, this would work perfectly for me, as I want ALL the contacts formatted in the E 164 format, no matter how they are stored by the user.      However, for APIs below 16, the above code won't work and I am not able to get the E 164 format for all contacts by using the following line:    c.getString(c.getColumnIndex(ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.NUMBER));      The 'PhoneNumberUtils' class could not come to any use.    Also, I cannot use the libphonenumber library to convert numbers to their E 164 format, as I don't know the ISO 3166-1 two letter country-code of the contacts.    Is there any way in which I can obtain the ISO 3166-1 two letter country-code for each contact in Android, so that I can use the libphonenumber library ?

["Oracle implicit cursor: for-else"," This is a very basic question, but what's the best way of writing a FORELSE into an implicit cursor in Oracle PL/SQL?  Some programming languages permit this kind of syntax, executing the FORELSE block when the cursor returns no rows.    What I want to achieve is something along the following lines (pseudo-code):    DECLARE     CURSOR test_cur IS         SELECT 'a'         FROM   table_with_zero_or_more_data; BEGIN     FOR r_ IN test_cur LOOP         Dbms_Output.Put_Line ('One extra row found');     FORELSE         Dbms_Output.Put_Line ('No data found');     END LOOP; END;     I've tried using exceptions as follows, but the NO_DATA_FOUND exception doesn't get triggered by an implicit cursor.    DECLARE      CURSOR test_cur IS         SELECT 'a'         FROM   table_with_zero_or_more_data; BEGIN     BEGIN         FOR r_ IN test_cur LOOP             Dbms_Output.Put_Line ('One extra row found');         END LOOP;     EXCEPTION         WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN             Dbms_Output.Put_Line ('No data found');     END; END;     The following does work of course (and there are similar variations, I have no doubt). But I just find this way a bit clunky. When the code becomes somewhat more real-life and verbose, it's not so obvious/intuitive that the IF statement is linked to the FOR loop. It also forces the introduction of a dummy variable, and just isn't syntactically beautiful.    DECLARE      CURSOR test_cur IS         SELECT 'a'         FROM   table_with_zero_or_more_data;     i NUMBER := 0; BEGIN     FOR r_ IN test_cur LOOP         i := i + 1;         Dbms_Output.Put_Line ('One extra row found');     END LOOP;     IF i = 0 THEN         Dbms_Output.Put_Line ('No data found');     END IF; END;     I just wonder if there's a better way, which is more intuitive and integrates the FOR and IF conditions?    EDIT    In case I wasn't clear enough, the point of this is to do it inside an IMPLICIT cursor.  I know I can use EXplicit cursors and check for %NOTFOUND etc. (actually %ROWCOUNT is better).

["Why use AngularJS instead of jQuery?"," I am a jQuery programmer, and have just started using angularjs. I have read a few tutorial on how to do use angular, but I am not clear on why to use it. Hence, I need following help from the community:      Please validate my understanding of Angularjs - Angular makes you think MVC, which perhaps means that you view your webpage as a template + data combination. You go around making your webpage, and keep on putting {{data bindings}} whenever you feel you would have dynamic data. Angular will then provide you a $scope handler, which you can populate (statically or through calls to the web server). This appears characteristically similar to jsp way of designing webpages.     For simple DOM manipulation, which doesnot involve data manipulation (eg: color changes on mousehover, hiding/showing elements on click), jQuery or old-school js is sufficient and cleaner. This assumes that the model in angular's mvc is anything that reflects data on the page, and hence, css properties like color, display/hide, etc changes dont affect the model.     Thanks in advance.    ps: if the question appears unconstructive or at the wrong place, please suggest me where shall I move it to. The jQuery/angular dilemma is certainly there in the developer community ",["jquery","mvc","angularjs"]]
["Can dynamically modifying django admin lead to race conditions?"," I've seen examples of django admin overrides that consist of modifying configuration fields (for example: based on the current user).  But I've never been clear on the lifetime/scope of admin objects, so I don't know if there is an opportunity for race conditions between multiple http requests.   When are admin objects  hydrated  and how are they shared?    Consider for example the following type of override:    class myAdmin(modelAdmin):     ...     def get_form(self, request,**kwargs):         if request.user.is_superuser:             self.readonly_fields = ()         else             self.readonly_fields = ('salary','title',)         super(myAdmin,self).get_form(request,**kwargs)     ...     Note: I know I could have (and would have!) implemented this example by overriding get_readonly_fields() instead --- I just picked this as a particularly simple example to demonstrate the idea.  Also, there is a lot written in the Django docs (and on SO) about race conditions with respect to model data, but admins aren't models and aren't stored in the DB.    So in this case, if an instance of myAdmin is hydrated per http request, or even single-threaded across requests, this overwriting should work fine.  But clearly it could go wrong if multiple requests were interleaved.   My guess is that admins are shared across multiple requests, but I have not seen this stated explicitly anywhere.   Is there a definitive answer? ",["django-admin"]]
